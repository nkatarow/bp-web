"Rethinking Brand Equity in the Digital Age","rethinking-brand-equity-in-the-digital-age","July 25, 2016","","Rebecca Jones","Recently, Bridge Partners along with 8works, invited business leaders across technology, banking, insurance, and the non-profit sector to our Solutions Exchange Lab in San Jose. The focus of the lab was building brand equity in a digital age. Digital has been working its way into mainstream for decades now—diligently chipping away the surface of many business models, while at the same time feeling like an overnight disruptive sensation.

The premise of a lab is three-fold: Cross-pollinate leaders from various industries with common challenges, apply insights and share perspectives, and leave with practical strategies to pilot in your organization. We spent the first part of our day setting a common foundation. We identified and assessed the issues that cross-cut organizations, departments, and industries with a focus on brand equity, customer experience, and driving sustainable growth. When it was all said and done, two key insights had emerged from the session.

 

UNDERSTAND YOUR PLACE AND SPACE

The first insight is simply stated: in order to create customer value, you need to first have a sense of place and space. It’s about culture, intent, leadership, organization design, and how individuals operate together with purpose. This opens up new ways to engage, collaborate, and innovate through pilot programs (whether they succeed or fail). By adjusting how you operate, you can better meet the needs of the modern customer. Take a look at Spotify’s approach to customer engagement and innovation (Part 1 / Part 2). It captures many of the principles that help us build our consulting practices and bring value to our customers. 

 

AUTOMATION DOES NOT EQUAL ENGAGEMENT

Another insight that surfaced in the lab is the fact that digital tools and automation are not synonymous with customer engagement. Your customer may not want to buy online. They may want to buy from you in a retail location but conduct research or book a service appointment online. Know your product and, more importantly, how your customer wants to engage with your brand, product, and employees.  Know your place and space in your customer’s lifecycle. You have a moment of relevance—perhaps many. Know when and where to engage and seize the moment!

 

FINAL THOUGHTS

Engaging with these business leaders at our Lab in San Jose was a rewarding experience. We challenged accepted practices, stirred the pot with new ideas, and walked away with actionable insights to leverage in our organizations. At the very least, everyone walked away with a fresh perspective and new connections with leaders willing to think differently.  

Our next Solutions Exchange Lab is scheduled for October in Seattle with limited availability. We are looking for thought leaders, game changers, and strategists with a desire to create change in your business. Contact me if you’re interested in joining us.","

"How to Tell Your Boss He is Wrong","how-to-tell-your-boss-he-is-wrong","July 21, 2016","","John Tribble","Your boss is wrong and you know it. Perhaps he (or she) is about to set a course of action or strategy that could lead to a major setback and needs to be warned against it. Or maybe he said the wrong thing to his team or client—a mistake you need to prevent from recurring. He might not even realize it, but you know he is wrong, and you know that no one else is going to tell the emperor he has no clothes.

The good news is that your boss probably wants you to speak your mind. Good leaders need trusted advisors, and if you can develop that relationship, it will benefit you both. If you work for a leader who doesn’t want that input, bigger problems are bound to eventually surface. Now, the question is how to tell your boss he is wrong.

 

BE TIMELY

It is important to find the right setting, which is usually a private moment. Delivering feedback in a public setting formalizes the disagreement and puts your boss on the spot to respond. Leaders don’t like their authority questioned in front of others, usually out of fear of losing the respect of the larger group. This makes your boss more likely to dig in his heels in front of others. Find the right time and setting, but also be proactive and request a private meeting before your boss has locked into a decision and made an official announcement. “I have been thinking about the retention strategy and would appreciate if I could bounce some ideas off you later today.” If you are encouraged by your boss in a team setting to provide your opinion, you might need to defer to a private moment. “I think this is a complicated issue, and I’d like to give it some additional thought and discuss later today.” 

 

BE RESPECTFUL

If, ultimately, your boss has the authority to stay the course you disagree with, your role is to be the trusted advisor. “I’ve been thinking about some factors I wanted to make sure you were aware of so you could make your decision with a full knowledge of the situation.” By reinforcing their role as decision maker, you aren’t challenging their authority, merely starting the conversation as the valuable provider of information. In the end, it might be necessary to jump on board if your boss is completely set on the path you disagree with, but for the good of the organization, you will have to execute it together. “Whatever you decide, you know I will back it one hundred percent, but if you are considering other opinions, I believe our best course of action is actually…”  Using the words “You are wrong” will alienate him. Instead, phrases like “I believe” or “maybe we should consider” allows your boss to come to the decision without feeling backed into it. Start subtle, and once he engages in the dialogue, you will have the opportunity to be more blunt.

 

BE LOGICAL

Leading with a gut feeling won’t build any credibility. Your boss needs a reason to change his mind. On what factors have you based your opinion? “Based on these factors, I think we should consider.” Perhaps he was not aware of those factors. Or maybe he was not aware of employee or client perception. Arguing over whether or not he used the right or wrong words is simply a matter of opinion, but telling him how the team or client responded is objective information. He may still think his approach is right, but if he knows how the group perceives it, he should at least listen to your point of view. 

 

WRAPPING UP

Ultimately, not expressing your opinion can lead to sleepless nights or a decision that negatively impacts your entire organization. When your boss knows that you are on his side and feel compelled to share the facts that led you to a different opinion, he will be open to feedback. In the future, he will be more likely to ask for your opinion before he sets his course. Your co-workers will notice that you have the ability to influence your manager, a distinction that can provide political capital. When done with proper finesse, the rewards for delivering a dissenting opinion are many—both for you and for your organization.  ","

"Five Content Marketing Mistakes to Avoid","five-content-marketing-mistakes-to-avoid","June 23, 2016","","Ethan Kalkwarf","Content marketing is a valuable tool to spark interest and build relationships with an audience, but too many marketers develop digital content without a strategic plan in place. A staggering 70% of marketers lack a consistent or integrated content strategy.1  In an environment ripe with competition, you need a concentrated, focused, and strategic approach. When mapping your content marketing plan, you’ll want to avoid these five key mistakes. 

 

LACK OF PURPOSE

Invest in content marketing because you have ideas to share, not just something to sell. Conventional marketing wisdom says that every piece of content needs an explicit call to action. I disagree. Every piece of content needs an explicit purpose. Sometimes that purpose is to encourage the audience to take action, and other times the purpose is to create awareness, generate a certain feeling, create buzz, or spark interest. Too often, brands are so busy trying to fill space in a blog, website, or newsletter that they forget their purpose. If you’re using content marketing just to create linkbacks to your site or fill an editorial calendar – stop! Take the time to deliver content that is fun, creative, informative, controversial, valuable, and most importantly, purposeful.  

 

INCONSISTENCY

Maintaining a consistent presence and consistent quality is key to a successful content marketing program. Set a rhythm and stick to it. Your content cadence will depend, among other things, on your creative resources, budget constraints, and business objectives. The key here is to establish a pace that you can maintain without falling into the aforementioned habit of cranking out mediocre content just to meet a deadline.

 

IGNORING A DISTRIBUTION PLAN

One way to quickly nullify your content marketing efforts is to ignore a distribution plan.  Will anyone read or interact with your content? They won’t without an automation or distribution plan in place. What has sometimes been referred to as the digital marketing trinity is your email list, social media presence, and search engine rankings. These three elements are the basis of your distribution plan. Build your email list, grow your social following on networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, and earn higher search engine rankings by consistently delivering quality content that is optimized and shareable. Also, make sure that you support your strongest pieces of content, if not all your content, with adequate demand gen funding. That could come in many forms, including sponsored social posts, banner ads, and search engine marketing.  

 

FORGETTING YOUR AUDIENCE

If you’re consistently producing content with an effective distribution mechanism in place, you’re all set, right? Wrong. If you’re creating content without understanding your audience, you run the risk of doing more harm than good. It may be time to create or update your buyer personas and study your target audience. Spend some time mapping your customers’ journey and measure how your content fits into each stage of their buying process. This activity will help you measure your effectiveness, and may also uncover gaps in your content plan.  

 

IGNORING ANALYTICS

No one data point can determine if your program is working. You’ll need to develop a comprehensive array of KPIs and metrics that track consumption, shares, engagement, and lead generation. When you start thinking in terms of dollars and not just eyeballs, analytics become a lot more important. How are your consumers sharing your content with others? Are you reaching key influencers in your industry? How is your content driving revenue? You’ll also want to differentiate between metrics that indicate the quality of your core content (e.g. time spent on page), the quality of your demand gen content (e.g. click through rate), and those that could be influenced by both (e.g. social shares).

 

As content marketing continues to disrupt traditional marketing methods, it is imperative you routinely audit your program to ensure you’re not making these five mistakes. To truly differentiate your brand, you must consistently produce content that adds value and speaks to customers. Take full advantage of the digital marketing trinity, remain patient, and don’t overlook the importance of analytics. Content marketing isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme, but over time, real commitment can pay off. ","

"Dispelling the Big Data Myth: A Practical Take on Talent Analytics","dispelling-the-big-data-myth-a-practical-take-on-talent-analytics","June 06, 2016","","Cynthia LaRowe","

It has become a truism that organizational talent is the biggest competitive advantage in the modern marketplace—and the biggest threat. As digital technology revolutionizes what can be known about employees and how that data can be leveraged by companies and competitors alike, massive generational workforce shifts put critical business intelligence and management capability at risk.  

Securing meaningful and actionable talent data is imperative to mitigating these risks and maintaining, if not gaining market share. But many companies ‘don’t know what they don’t know’ about their talent and are stymied about where and how to start. In some cases, they lack the technology and capabilities to capture and apply talent data in meaningful ways. In others, they lack the leadership needed to change these factors and an effective decision framework to act on the data they have. 

This lack of readiness comes at a high cost. Companies that don’t leverage talent analytics are at risk of losing relevance to their customers and employees. Talent analytics may be defined simply as finding meaningful data elements and relationships to make fact-based people decisions. In day-to-day practice, however, what does that mean?

 

It's not about the numbers

Gathering and using data for modeling and forecasting are just part of effective talent analytics. Elegant visualization and story-telling—creating “beautiful evidence,” per Edward Tufte—are also critical. In fact, the value of talent analytics may lie less in data itself and more in how data is interpreted and presented to create the intended awareness and impact. Once a niche specialty, impactful data visualization is now equal access thanks to tools like Tableau and Power BI. 

The business benefits are clear. Multiple studies point to the value of using talent analytics to help drive critical measures like best-in-class business performance and higher revenue per employee. In Competing on Talent Analytics, for example, the Harvard Business Review describes net increases in employee engagement, operating income, and high potential performance and retention at companies like Starbucks, The Limited Brands, Best Buy, AT&T, Google, and Sprint—all of whom have dedicated talent analytics functions and use talent data to drive people processes and practices.

 

One size does not fit all

It is a common assumption that business-critical talent metrics are standard across companies and that, once those metrics are defined, capturing employee data is the primary work. As a result, many companies devote more effort to data capture than to data analysis.

Talent metrics are not one-size-fits-all, however. Data that is essential for one company may not make sense to another depending on several factors:  


	Strategic business objectives and success measures: What a company is trying to achieve and how it defines success
	Stakeholder needs and engagement: End-user access to data, involvement in data management, and constraints
	Data systems and visualization maturity, capacity, and intent: Ability to effectively visualize and manage data


 

Culture rules

Peter Drucker is attributed with saying “culture eats strategy for breakfast.” The same might be said for cloud maturity. While an intentional approach to digital technology is imperative in the modern marketplace, organizational leadership and culture may still counter-balance technical sophistication in driving business results. 

Best-in-class leaders create cultures that are responsive to all types of data and value evidence-based decision-making. They demand hard and soft people data and drive operations that are agile in identifying and aligning people metrics to key business results. 

 

Finding the right balance

Understanding what drives a company is key to identifying which metrics should guide strategic decisions. A business decision framework is one way to map top strategic differentiators and risk tolerance alongside the talent metrics and people processes that drive them.  Another key tool is a change management plan that addresses analytics findings.

An “all or nothing” mentality can hold companies back from investing in talent analytics. Talent analytics maturity may range, though, from simple metrics and dashboards to predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making. Taking a modular approach and scaling capabilities—maintaining legacy platforms as needed while adopting agile analytics processes for developing tools and delivering data—is a good way to start.

Following your employees’ lead can also help set talent analytics priorities. Modern employees expect companies to use data to connect them more closely with the products, services, programs, and experiences they provide.  Leading companies leverage data from inside and outside the corporate environment to anticipate and address employee needs. 

The end result? Active engagement that drives long-term interest, productivity, and loyalty.  Competitive advantage at its best.","

"Partners for a Stronger Community","partners-for-a-stronger-community","May 18, 2016","","Richard Albrecht","As the CEO of a people-based business, one of my favorite things to do is meet with our consultants one-on-one over coffee. It is incredibly important to me to make real connections with the people who make our company great and build relationships with people at every level of our growing firm. Because it’s easy to get caught up in the daily grind and overlook one of the most important things in our business (our people), I make a concerted effort to meet someone new every week. 

A few weeks ago, I met with one of our stars, D'Laina Boynton. Over some of Seattle’s finest brew, she shared her passion for causes that make our communities happier, stronger, and safer. Her desire was to create opportunities for Bridge employees, families, and friends to join together and make an impact outside the office. With D’Laina leading this effort, we formally started a Bridge Volunteer Community to organize and plan volunteer events throughout the year. We knew we had an incredible team with diverse talents and passions and we learned that when we join together and make an intentional effort, we can truly be a force for good in our community.

Earlier this month, we partnered with the March of Dimes, and employees from our Seattle office volunteered in support of the annual March for Babies of Puget Sound. Next month, we’ll partner with Seattle Parks and Recreation to do a park cleanup. In addition to the time and energy our people invest in local causes, corporate support is also an important part of our approach to community service. Bridge supports local public education initiatives such as the Alliance for Education and Rainier Scholars, as well as global health non-profit PATH. Further, our matched, employee-directed giving program has expanded our reach considerably.

I’m truly proud of the contributions our team has made to the communities where we live and work. Since we started this company in 2006, we’ve sought to create an environment where our people are empowered to contribute, have real influence on how we do business, and work together to build a positive, meaningful culture. It’s what Bridge Partners is all about.

"Help Yourself to Better Meetings","help-yourself-to-better-meetings","May 12, 2016","","Cristofer Munson","

Raise your hand if you’ve ever led a meeting that fell flat. Raise your other hand if you’ve ever participated in a meeting that was boring and a waste of your time. Now lower your hands because, wherever you are, people are staring at you and probably think you’re being robbed.

And aren’t we all being robbed (in a way) when we are forced to sit through meetings that don’t live up to their potential? We’re being robbed of our time and our talent—perhaps two of our most valuable human resources. 

There are treasure troves of books and articles that can help you plan and execute a successful meeting. When I search for the phrase “how to have a successful meeting,” I get 79,300,000 hits. You’ve no doubt read at least some of them. I’ve read more than my fair share, and it is not my intention to repeat the “top tips for meeting management” here. Even if I did, they wouldn’t necessarily be of help to you because we don’t always get to plan and lead every meeting we attend and we are, it seems, at the mercy of the person in charge. So, I wanted to share some thoughts on how you can help yourself in any meeting situation.

To improve the quality of any meeting, I recommend the following:

“Manage the energy, not the meeting.”

To do this, the first thing you have to recognize is that every meeting has a certain energy—that sense of engagement with, and interest in, the topic at hand. You can have the best objectives, the best agenda, the best content, the best facility, the best tools…the best of the best. But if you’re not mindful of the energy flowing (or not flowing) during the course of a meeting, you run the risk of robbing everyone of their time and talent.

To be clear, I’m not suggesting that a meeting has to be all “rah-rah” and fun-filled to be effective. In fact, some of the best meetings are serious and intense, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences significant. What I am suggesting, however, is that you can be aware of the energy level and empower yourself to make a positive impact on a moment-to-moment basis. This is true regardless if you are leading the meeting or “just” participating in it. Here are some simple ways you can help yourself to a better meeting. 

 

WAYS TO HEIGHTEN YOUR ENERGY AWARENESS


	Surrender to this truth: every meeting has energy. The trick is to have it be the energy you want.  What energy do you want to create and experience?
	Observe the pulse of the energy in the meeting. Is there one?
	Observe yourself. Are you interested and engaged? If not, why? What can you do to become so right now?
	Observe others. Are they interested and engaged? What can you do to engage others right now?


This last question is the most critical to helping yourself to a better meeting: “What can you do to engage others (and yourself) right now?”  The best and simplest way that I have found to achieve that objective is to do this: 

Focus on what you can contribute to the meeting—not on what you’re getting out of it.

Seriously. Try it. This simple change in attitude (i.e., “how can I contribute”) can dramatically change your experience in any meeting. For example, if you are sitting in a meeting and you sense everyone has gone down a “rabbit hole,” be the one that speaks up and says so. If you have the sense that others in the room may have a question that they’re not asking, ask it—even if you know the answer (that’s a great way of making sure that others have the same information you have without coming off as a “know-it-all”). If you think of something (appropriately) funny, say it. Humor is a great way to inject pure energy into a meeting.

 

SUMMARY

I’m purposely not offering suggestions on how to improve meetings through better planning, preparation, execution, etc. As noted earlier, there are already 79 million iterations of great ideas out there. And those rules, tips, and tricks don’t work universally well for everyone. Even if they did, they can’t give you the power to improve your own experience in the moment. The best way to achieve that, in my experience, is by being aware of the meeting energy and focusing on what you can give more than on what you can get in any moment.","

"Selling Cloud Solutions to Government Agencies","selling-cloud-solutions-to-government-agencies","May 04, 2016","","Jerry Leishman","

RESPONDING TO SECURITY THREATS

Federal, state, and local agencies are vulnerable to cyber-attacks for many reasons. But the biggest factor is their inability to keep pace with the changing tools and technology deployed by their attackers. The dizzying rate of change has left them flat-footed, facing seemingly insurmountable technical barriers.

In order to identify, stop, and remediate the damage of cyberattacks, government agencies are now pursuing multiple approaches. These include:  


	Embracing the 2011 “Cloud First” Whitehouse policy in an effort to take advantage of the cloud value proposition and security capabilities.
	Investing in third-party technologies to help quickly mitigate security breaches, audit failures, and known gaps in their security profile.
	Requiring internal and external services and products to meet more rigorous certifications, such as NIST 800-53, to help improve their overall security profile and the effectiveness of their controls.


 

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

These are good point approaches, but they still lack the vision and implementation speed needed to keep up with the changing technology landscape and the threat from cyber criminals. This gap has created a multibillion-dollar opportunity for cloud-based SaaS providers with federal certifications such as FISMA, FedRAMP, and DISA. According to IDC, the federal government alone will spend $6.7 billion on cloud technologies in 2016 and $11.5 billion by 2019.

There is no doubt that companies are making a significant investment to build security and compliance solutions. In March, the annual RSA Conference hosted over 40,000 attendees, 400 sessions, and nearly 1,000 vendors. For the most part, though, these vendors are focused on commercial opportunities. This is due to the time and money it takes to achieve federal certifications such as FISMA, FedRAMP, and DISA.

 

CSP PARTNERSHIPS

If you are a SaaS provider interested in the government marketplace, your SaaS certification process could be streamlined and costs minimized by working with a Cloud Service Platform (CSP) that has already achieved these federal certifications for their IaaS and PaaS services. This enables you to reduce your certification down to the SaaS layer and reuse the CSP’s certifications. Microsoft and Amazon are two leading CSPs that have already achieved US Government FISMA, FedRAMP, and some DISA certifications.  

Bridge Partners helps CSPs and third-party SaaS providers work together to enter the government market. The effort and timetables will vary for every SaaS provider, depending on your compliance and security maturity, but you could achieve your certifications at a lower cost and on an accelerated timetable. A CSP interested in partnering with a SaaS provider will be interested in their potential government revenue opportunity as well as the SaaS provider’s financial health and management ability.

Those that can meet these CSP expectations will be in a position to become an early government cloud SaaS market entrant and create a competitive advantage over other third-party SaaS providers.

 

NEXT STEPS

For organizations interested in pursuing this multibillion-dollar marketplace, we recommend that you do the following:


	Assess the need for your SaaS solution by US government agencies. Does your solution have demonstrated evidence in the commercial marketplace?  If not, we recommend focusing on commercial cloud implementations first. The exception is if you already have government customers that have implemented your on-premises solutions. If those same customers are candidates for your SaaS offering, you should move forward.
	Select the best government CSP. Selecting the right CSP is a critical component of your success in the government marketplace. If you want to meet the requirements of your target customers, you’ll need to pay special attention to security, privacy, and compliance policies when evaluating prospective CSPs.
	Achieve your federal, state, and local certifications. Most organizations have not invested in control assessments or the required policy, documentation, and technical requirements to achieve certifications. You should be fully aware of these requirements and ask if your organization is prepared to invest the time and money needed to succeed.    
	Co-sell your SaaS solution. In order to sell to government agencies, you should leverage your CSP. If they have a strong government sales organization, you’ll benefit from their credibility, relationships, and access. And, since CSP sellers are compensated based on resource consumption (e.g. compute, storage, network, etc.), they are motivated to sell applications that drive consumption, not just their platform.


Success won’t come overnight. But for organizations that have the management support, technical skills, compliance maturity, and patience, the government cloud services market presents a multibillion-dollar opportunity.

"The Next Generation of Sales Enablement","the-next-generation-of-sales-enablement","April 25, 2016","","","With the help of Bridge Partners, a global technology leader is more effectively demonstrating business value for its customers.



GREATER EXPECTATIONS

The digital revolution has changed the way we access information and has transformed the way products are bought and sold. Today’s sales organizations must respond and adapt to buyers’ changing behavior. For example, the role and impact of personal relationships on the sales process has moderated while business value is as important as ever. Buyers are hungry for industry expertise, third-party research, and objective advice, and they can access this information from a broad set of credible sources. Most importantly, buyers want to work with a vendor who understands their business challenges and opportunities. To succeed, today’s sellers need the right tools and resources to facilitate discussions centered on business value.

 

BRIDGING THE GAP

Our customer, a global Fortune 50 technology leader, approached Bridge Partners for help closing the gap between what buyers wanted from the sales process and what sellers could deliver. Buyers wanted clear data on business value and ROI. The sales teams needed a new approach and better tools to promote the business value of their software solutions. The old approach—an all-too-familiar product and feature based sales presentation—often resulted in conversations disconnected from industry, business, and functional area goals. Our team of consultants knew that for our customer to have relevant sales conversations, we would need to help them solve their customers’ business problems.



AN INNOVATIVE ENABLEMENT TOOL

We worked with our client to build a customer-facing pre-sales workshop that helps prepare sellers for business value conversations with buyers. This interactive, online tool allows the seller to input information about a prospective buyer’s business, industry, functional role, and market segment. The tool then uses customer information and predefined business scenarios to create customized content for key buyer types. It helps sellers facilitate a consultative workshop with buyers and focuses the conversation on customer needs. By providing a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator to help prove ROI, ready-to-go business proposals, and workshop presentations, the sales conversation keeps moving forward.

 

DRIVING SALES

At the end of the day, sales enablement is about empowering sellers to drive new business. The tool Bridge Partners developed is helping sellers have more productive business value conversations. Sales presentations are no longer confined to static pitches that focus on features and benefits. Instead, customer needs are in the driver’s seat, and sellers are positioned to respond to those needs with dynamic, personalized content supported by quantitative evidence and third-party validation. It all adds up to more sales, faster pipeline velocity, and satisfied customers. ","

"Four Coaching Pitfalls to Avoid","four-coaching-pitfalls-to-avoid","April 25, 2016","","John Tribble","

When one of your direct reports (or even a peer) struggles with a performance issue, it affects the entire team. It can cost your business money and even give your competition the advantage. You can help by providing thoughtful feedback and coaching. But if you don’t have the right attitude and approach, you can cause irreparable damage to those relationships and have the opposite effect on performance. In order to build strong relationships and get the best out of your team, you’ll want to avoid these four common coaching pitfalls.

Pitfall Number One: Trying to act like a boss. Start with the mindset that you are the coach, not the boss. Make sure your direct report knows you want him to succeed, and that you have some valuable feedback that will allow him to course-correct before the problem becomes too large to fix. He won’t change simply because you demand it, and he won’t react positively if you use language like “you made me look bad.” Instead, he will want to know that you share his best interests and can provide a roadmap for how to change. 

Pitfall Number Two: Being unclear. As a coach, your job is to point out the specific action or steps that he needs to take in order to be successful. Find out if your organization has role guides, job frameworks, or other documentation that can provide you and your direct report a playbook with mutually understandable guidelines. Even a job description is better than nothing. Many performance gaps are not due to lack of skill, but rather a lack of clear expectations. If you take responsibility for not laying out clearer expectations previously, you will create a foundation of trust with your employee.

Pitfall Number Three: Sharing opinions instead of defining the problem.  Use facts to compare and contrast your direct report’s performance against expectations (this is a good time to point back to clearly documented roles and responsibilities). Identify specific examples so that each of you are on the same page. Do not focus on the possible cause of the shortfall or anything else that is debatable. A common issue here is for employees to feel like their manager is out to get them. Your direct report will feel this way if the performance gap is purely based on opinion or if your feedback includes vague language such as “the plan needs to be more strategic.” Break down his responsibility into clear, observable, and/or measurable components, leveraging whatever role-based documentation exists.

Pitfall Number Four: Not having a game plan.  This is an opportunity that your direct report can and should embrace. It is important that they buy into the need for change and agree to a performance improvement plan. That plan should include answers to the following:


	Objective – What is the level of performance that is required?
	Action plan – What specifically will be completed or measured and when is the deadline? 
	Checkpoint – When will you meet again to review progress. Start with short-term milestones (2 weeks out) and gradually lengthen the time to 30, 60, and then 90 days.


It is critical that you actively manage the plan over a long period of time. If performance meets expectations, recognize that at checkpoints or even between them, so your employee feels the momentum of being on track.

Simply demanding better performance, as if it were a manager’s right, is not enough to generate sustainable improvement. Managers that approach the conversation with a coach’s mindset, provide a playbook to clarify expectations, identify specific issues, and partner with their employees have the best chance of improving performance and building loyalty. Managers and direct reports that come through this process together forge rewarding relationships and continue learning together.","

"Getting Up and Running with Marketing Automation","getting-up-and-running-with-marketing-automation","March 28, 2016","","Christopher Ferris","

The goal of a marketing program is to serve the right content at the right time to your target audience. The goal of a marketing automation program is no different. Automation shouldn’t change what you want to accomplish, but it should save you time and money while helping you scale. Unfortunately, the amount of effort it takes to establish and maintain a marketing automation system is often costlier than the rewards. Here are a few things you should understand if you want to get marketing automation off the ground and see positive ROI.

 

SIMPLE IS GOOD

If you’re considering marketing automation as a solution for your business, you’ll soon learn that getting things up and running is a complex task. It requires the coordination of many disciplines and overlapping dependencies. For example, you’ll need to consider the following:


	Content strategy. What do you want your customers to do, learn, and ultimately purchase? How often do you communicate with your leads and when are they ready for sales calls?
	Content journey. What is the right way to show the lifecycle of your leads so that your key decision makers can make sense of it?
	Content development. What is the right message for new leads, and how much content do you create to support a lead’s specific interests?
	Automation software. What automation product will you use? How much can you manage in-house and how much support do you need from technical experts?
	Development costs and efforts. Do you have the right email templates and page templates? Do you have a website ready to support new content? And what new materials do you need to create?
	Demand generation. Once your story is ready to unfold, how will your audience find it? And will you generate enough traffic through the journey to justify the costs of implementation?


Once you get started, many other sub-projects will add themselves to this list. These can stir up whirlpools among your stakeholders, creating distracting discussions and subsequent delays. With that in mind, you’ll need clear priorities. The first iteration should be as simple as possible. Leave optimization and diversification to subsequent efforts.

 

CONTENT IS KING

No customer is impressed by automation. To her, there is nothing compelling about it at all. Customers care about content, so your first priority should be capturing their attention and offering something of value. One of the tools that can help you craft engaging content is the customer persona.  If done thoughtfully, persona research provides a frame of reference, not just for content writers, but also for:


	Content strategists. Where do we find our audience? How do we tell our story?
	Nurture journey architects. How do we encourage leads to discover solutions for themselves? Will the journey surface qualified leads effectively?
	Interactive developers. How can we use the best technologies to simplify, support, and enhance the experience for leads?


 

THE JOURNEY MATTERS

The next important task is to define the first journey, the starting point, and the minimum viable product. One of the great benefits that come with an automation platform (once it is operational) is that your marketing campaigns can be observed, tested, measured, and improved.

In order to get that first journey launched, you’ll need to identify the most basic conversation you will have with your customers. It’s tempting to have your journey account for every one-off and corner case (we are conditioned to look for exceptions and to illuminate them). But try to resist this urge. Plan for the first journey to serve the simplest need and target the largest behavior set—whether it’s 80 percent of your audience or even 50 percent.

One way to look at this philosophy is from a Six Sigma planning approach:


	Identify the most obvious opportunities for improvement
	Focus on the biggest and most obvious, and create a solution
	Measure that solution’s performance while dreaming up solutions for the second most obvious opportunity
	Iterate and choose only the next most obvious/valuable opportunity


 

THE FUTURE IS NEAR

When planning your first marketing automation program, it can be a challenge to focus on today without losing sight of tomorrow. New ideas will abound, and future concerns will surface. You’ll need to compartmentalize the planning conversation into short, medium, and long-term thinking. Dive into the short-term challenges as they must be overcome to begin the program. Use the medium-term concerns to help shape a scalable solution. And let long-term thinking help you recognize and plan for big ideas that are before their time. This approach will help you manage scope, control costs, and make the necessary short-term decisions with the long-run ROI in mind.","

"A Cure for the Common Course","a-cure-for-the-common-course","March 03, 2016","","","When one of the nation’s leading hospitals needed to expand its leadership training program, they turned to Bridge Partners.  

 



TRAINING LEADERS TO PUT PATIENTS FIRST

One of the nation’s leading hospitals was challenged to scale a beloved leadership effectiveness program across the entire organization. Hospital executives agreed that the program was the right way to grow leadership, articulate a unique culture, reinforce a strong brand, and prepare management to lead according to shared values. However, right-sizing this home-grown course and deploying it to hundreds of managers across the organization presented a new challenge.

The existing instructional design was highly labor-intensive. Course content was organized in binders, and key processes were documented on sticky notes. Invitations, registrations, logistics, and speaker schedules were all completed manually. With a successful program already up and running, our client was faced with the challenge of re-building a plane that was already in flight.

 

BUILDING A SCALABLE PROGRAM

Our customer needed a strategic partner to help scale and deliver an effective training experience across the hospital environment, without impacting the quality of course content or delivery. With extensive experience in the healthcare industry and expertise in change management and instructional design, Bridge Partners had the right team for the job. Our team worked with hospital leadership and other key stakeholders to develop and implement the training program on a broader scale. Using a Six-Sigma approach, Bridge Partners delivered the tools, assets, and processes needed to meet the complex requirements of the organization.



IMPROVING PROCESSES AND STREAMLINING WORKFLOWS

Bridge Partners helped rewrite the instructional guides and program details into clear job aids and work schedules. Course content moved from three-ring binders into a user-friendly SharePoint site. Now, the program is conducted weekly by a variety of managers and executives as incoming leadership is seamlessly integrated into this world-class healthcare organization. Course content is easily updated as leadership themes evolve and the leadership training course has become a strategic asset for the C-suite. The improved process and streamlined workflow allows our customer to grow the next generation of leaders while remaining focused on its mission to put patients first.","

"Top Ten Signs You’re Pulling – Not Pushing – Your Customers","top-ten-signs-youre-pulling-not-pushing-your-customers","February 29, 2016","","Cindy Lavoie","You’re Not Still Push-Marketing, Are You?

 

Marketing has been turned on its head in recent years, and if you’ve done traditional marketing for a long time, you may still be struggling to make the switch from traditional marketing ‘push’ to content marketing ‘pull’ techniques. Today’s savvy marketers know that customers are turned off and tuned out from invasive push-marketing tactics, and they’re demanding more control over when and where they pay attention to branded content.

The key to successful marketing is shifting away from traditional push strategies, recognizable in language such as:


	Target your market
	Advertise your product benefits
	Convince your prospects to buy


…to a new set of pull strategies, with language such as:


	Be available in the right places
	Build connection and trust
	Provide value before expecting a purchase


I’m not suggesting you abandon all push-marketing activities; most companies find that a mix of both works best. But don’t underestimate the change in mindset required by the pull approach. Here are some tell-tale signs you’re successfully making the switch:

 

1.   Your blog posts, tweets, and social media comments don’t all start with “I” or “we.”

2.   Your customers are finding you more often than you are finding them.

3.   You’re more excited to address your customers’ challenges than to talk about your product’s new features.

4.   Your online persona has an individual personality and voice, rather than just a corporate brand image.

5.   People are sharing your comments and content across social media channels because it has intrinsic value to them.

6.   You feel more like a publisher than a marketer or sales person.

7.   You worry less about building your prospect or email list, and more about building your editorial calendar.

8.   You’re hyper-aware of your most valuable keyword terms, and you actively weave them into what you write for online consumption.

9.   Your website is optimized to attract the audience you are targeting, and offers clear next steps for your qualified visitors.

10.   You track and measure all online engagements so you can clearly refine the elements that are most successful at pulling visitors to your site, then converting them to qualified leads and buyers.","

"Riding the Big Bang: Winning in a World of Constant Disruption","riding-the-big-bang-winning-in-a-world-of-constant-disruption","February 22, 2016","","Charles KwonMay Pao","THE INNOVATOR’S DILEMMA

In his 1997 bestselling book, The Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen argues that large firms often miss out on opportunities to grow because innovative products with disruptive potential are rejected by most customers, due to their higher defect rate. As a result, smaller competitors are able to go to market with less mature products that meet the needs of lower-end customers. From there, these innovators move up-market as they refine their products over time. This was the case with televisions, radios, mobile phones, disk drives, and many other major breakthroughs.



 

BIG BANG DISRUPTION

Fast forward to 2013. Larry Downes and Paul Nunes publish an article in Harvard Business Review entitled Big Bang Disruption. They suggest that technological advances have sped up innovation to the point that industry disruptors no longer rely on selling a flawed product to the lower end of the market. In fact, innovators hit the market with a product that may be better, faster, more customized, and cheaper—all at the same time. This Big Bang is the result of converging technologies like mobile, cloud, and analytics. It’s accelerated by the fact that the delivery model is via a networked digital infrastructure. Think of the impact Uber had on taxis or Google Maps on handheld GPS devices. These offers both leverage digital networks to drive usage and scale.



The path to Big Bang disruption is non-linear and unpredictable. Facilitated by what Gartner has dubbed the Nexus of Forces—cloud, social, mobile, and big data—Big Bang disruptions can happen seemingly overnight, leaving industry leaders little time to respond. Understanding disruption and addressing it effectively has become one of the top priorities in the C-suite today. It’s a recurring theme in our conversations with clients—particularly those running technology-enabled businesses. Here are a few ways that we see the Big Bang impacting business and what you can do to respond.  

 

INDUSTRY STRUCTURE

With the move to the cloud well underway for most businesses, hardware and software are turning into commodities. That’s because users are more interested in what the solution does than what platform it runs on or who makes it. With less physical infrastructure, easier integration and deployment, and subscription pricing, switching costs are declining rapidly. These trends are speeding up the progression to market leadership, defining winners and losers in the marketplace faster than ever. The resulting “winner take all” phenomenon has a major impact on share within each disruptive market.



And market share isn’t the only thing changing. Barriers to entry are increasingly not barriers at all. In many cases, companies are simply jumping into a new sector or market. Hardware and software companies become cloud companies. Point-solutions move up the value chain to provide integrated solutions. Channel partners become solutions providers, etc.

 

CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR

The Big Bang is affecting customer behavior as well. Customers expect access to information when and where they need it. They also expect to get a highly personalized experience and to pay on a consumption basis. If you’re like me, you probably did most of your Christmas shopping online this year. But, if you did go to the mall, you probably saw the few people that were there walking around, looking at their phones—comparing online and instore prices, reading reviews, checking availability, and looking at their kids’ Amazon wish lists.

Even in the B2B world, the Big Bang has had a radical impact on customer behavior. Buying decisions are no longer limited to the CIO or the Line of Business Executive. End users (i.e. workers and managers) within an organization are making incremental purchases and deploying cloud-based solutions with little or no input from IT departments—just bill a credit card and put it on the expense report. Employees are increasing their productivity and expect to be able go out and get the tools they need to do their job on an on demand basis. 

 

GO-TO-MARKET

As technological disruptions accelerate, industry structures change, and customer behavior and patterns evolve, smart executives are finding ways to adjust business models, offerings, and go-to-market strategies (GTM). The most successful companies are doing two things. First, they’re listening more closely than ever to customer needs. Those needs are changing quickly, and it doesn’t take long for competitors to meet them. Second, they’re developing new disruptive businesses alongside their core business. This helps them respond to customer needs and competitive pressures. Some achieve this via internal efforts (intrepreneurship) and some through acquisition (M&A).

 

NEXT STEPS

The first step to handling the Big Bang is recognizing that accelerated technological disruption is moving forward with or without you. Those who come to this realization sooner rather than later will be equipped to survive and thrive in the future. Once you’ve recognized this reality, there are five key steps to consider.

1. Conduct a strategic assessment. You’ll need to understand the business landscape and your own key leverage points.

2. Understand customer needs. Leverage social platforms, big data, and business analytics to understand what customers want to see from your business, not just today, but in the future too.

3. Update your offers to meet customer needs. Don’t just wait for pressure from your competitors. Anticipate customer needs and drive innovation with evolving customer needs in mind. Better to disrupt yourself than have a competitor disrupt you.

4. Redefine your GTM strategy. If you’ve learned from the market, listened to your customers, and understand your leverage points, you may find yourself in an entirely new market with new partners and sales approaches.

5. Learn and adapt. You’ll be most successful if you commit to continuously pilot, refine, and rollout new offerings and capabilities to your core business.  Executive commitment and organizational processes are key to success.

Big Bang disruption brings both challenges and opportunities for all of us, but those who leverage its potential to drive innovation will be the winners.","

"Should You Fire Yourself?","should-you-fire-yourself","February 04, 2016","","Matthew Cadman","

Recently, I’ve had some interesting conversations with clients, colleagues, and friends about how busy life is. In fact, I doubt you’ll make it through this blog post without some kind of interruption! Excessive busyness has become a regular part of our lives. Some of us are expert task-jugglers (or at least it looks that way). Others of us struggle with the juggling act.    

As we start a new year, it’s a great time to ask yourself if your juggling act is preventing you from achieving your goals. If the answer is yes, then I’d like to issue you a challenge: fire yourself. That might sound a little scary. Maybe even completely crazy. But the bottom line is that if you have too much on your plate, you will never be successful.

I’m not saying that you need to quit your job or give up on your career. And I’m definitely not saying that you should sacrifice your personal relationships to be successful at work. I am saying that you can’t do it all. And no matter how energetic or strong willed you are, at some point, you have to focus on the things that make a difference. If you feel overwhelmed, can’t find enough time in the day, don’t get enough sleep, and watch your weekdays run into weekends over and over again, know that there is hope…but you might need to fire yourself. Here’s how to do it.

 

HOW TO FIRE YOURSELF

1. Set clear goals. Start with five goals. Once you clarify your top priorities, you’ll quickly identify areas where you need to fire yourself. Understanding your objectives, and limiting how many you have, will provide you with the best opportunity to be successful. You still have to be smart and work hard, but eliminating the things that are getting in your way will help you become much more effective, almost overnight.

2. Know when to say “no.” You might be pretty good at setting five goals. But how often do you say no? An extra project at work. Another home improvement. A social outing. You probably have the best intentions when you say yes. “If I give extra support to my team or my manager, that will help me get ahead at work.” “If I say yes to another project at home, then I’ll be able to get more done and finally relax with my family.”

The fact is that you can’t make everyone happy, all of the time. Pretty soon, your list of goals has doubled from five to ten and you’re on track to achieve maybe one or two of them. Firing yourself will only work if you learn to say no. Otherwise, you’ll end up right back where you started—overwhelmed and underachieving.

3. Ask for help. Have you ever been assigned a project (even one related to your top five goals) and felt that empty feeling in your stomach because you knew it would be a ton of work and you might not have the resources you need? When that happens, ask for help. Help comes in many forms: reprioritizing your work load, getting some extra budget to hire outside help, or taking something off your list. Whatever form it takes, it’s okay to speak up and make sure that your manager or your partner in life knows that you need help. It isn’t about being strong or weak, rather, it’s about being honest and being able to deliver on your promises.

 

FINAL THOUGHTS

As you think about your life, professionally and personally, I encourage you to take a realistic look under your own hood. Are your priorities clear? Do you know how to say no and ask for help? Can you have an honest discussion with your manager at work and your partner at home? If you can, that is fantastic. If you can’t, or if you feel like you’re running out of energy and focus, then it might be time to fire yourself from the things that are getting in the way. I think you’ll quickly find that you’re more effective in every aspect of life. And throughout the year, make sure to give yourself permission to do some things just for you.","

"One Simple Suggestion That Could Save Your GRC Program","one-simple-suggestion-that-could-save-your-grc-program","January 22, 2016","","Michael Nido","

A long time ago, in a consulting firm far, far, away, we were taught a somewhat counterintuitive principle: work backward. This proved to be an effective way to approach many difficult problems. We read complex documents from back to front, begin business process maps at the end and work toward the beginning, look at transactions from the client’s desired end result first, and so forth.

Today’s approach to Enterprise Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) should really be no different.  Separated into its constituent parts, GRC is the confluence of three seemingly distinct disciplines: Corporate Governance, Enterprise Risk Management, and Legal & Regulatory Compliance. Blending the three in the modern organization is truly an art.

Those who touch GRC on a daily basis—Corporate Counsel, CIO’s, Policy Directors, and many others—should work in reverse from the strategic goal to be achieved on behalf of the organization, back to the operational tasks that need to be executed to “make it happen.” This is a bit different, and more comprehensive, than the oft-repeated “Begin with the End in Mind” proviso. Under the backwards analysis principle, we actually do begin at the end, and all analysis and strategic mapping is then planned in reverse from the end state.        

For example, your desired end state might be to have a fully-developed Corporate Compliance plan in place by December 31st. The underpinnings of such a GRC project are quite complex, to be sure. But the various operational tasks become much clearer when you first understand what you are trying to achieve. Do you want to obtain a certification, develop a corporate policy, or reduce risk? These three objectives might be closely related, but it is important to define them separately. Similarly, the line between strategy and operations should be clear. While a business can afford some variations in operational execution, it can almost never afford mistakes in strategy.    

Stephen Covey wrote about understanding the difference between the functions of “What to Do” and “How to Do.” Thinking about your GRC program in a holistic manner from desired finishing point back to starting point is clearly a “What to Do” function (which was, according to Covey, a higher-level task within an organization). It is really the entire conceptualization and design of the GRC program. Much of the actual execution of the program—the “How to Do”—can be carefully delegated to your operational staff or outsourced.

Moreover, the backwards analysis principle also allows us to work conceptually from the general, down to the specific, similar to the methodology utilized in cladistic diagrams. In cladistic analysis, a scientist will begin with the most general classification of organisms, and then drill-down level by level until the organism is properly classified. You should think in similar terms about GRC concepts—beginning with the goal to be achieved on behalf of the organization, and then schematically outlining each group of tasks or workflows required to accomplish the higher-level objective. This will also provide you with a neatly-packaged hierarchy that can be useful for internal audit purposes, resource justification, internal costing, and, perhaps most importantly, quantifying progress. The cladistic diagram will effectively be your primary roadmap for conceptualizing your program.  

There is another unexpected benefit of starting at the end: the degree of buy-in from your Board of Directors and C-Suite is enhanced because your program is built around organizational goals. A GRC program constructed in reverse with a comprehensive understanding of law, corporate policy, and societal goals will be more enduring, effective, and easily applied across the entire corporate organization.

And finally, enjoy the pride and purpose knowing that you are delivering your GRC program at a strategic level, not an operational or tactical level. Working in reverse will help you perform your functions holistically, at a high level, and not become mired in ‘the thick of thin things.’ You will demonstrate the intellectual discipline of understanding the end game and aligning your GRC program and its execution to the overall corporate vision, mission, and goals.               ","

"Cybersecurity: Know the Enemy of Your Business","cybersecurity-know-the-enemy-of-your-business","January 20, 2016","","Gordon Matlock","""If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” - Sun Tzu

 

Nation-states, cyber criminals, and cyber terrorists may have different objectives, but they now share their codes, techniques, and information to attack U.S. industries. Their collaborative efforts have the potential to undermine the backbone of our critical infrastructure and economy. With cyber threats rapidly increasing in number and complexity, leading executives face more pressure than ever to protect their corporate assets.

During graduate school at the United States Naval War College, I studied military philosophy, military strategists, and leadership on the battlefield. Today, as I look at the cyber landscape, I see many similarities between the decisions made on the battlefield and the decisions made in the C-Suite.

Similar to a commander in battle, the modern executive is asked to minimize risk, stay one step ahead of the adversary, and make crucial decisions—sometimes with limited insight. To make matters worse, an executive must also consider strategic business priorities, competitive pressures, and the rapidly changing technology landscape. It’s a daunting task, but one that becomes more manageable when executives start with the right questions. For example:


	How likely is my company to suffer a loss?
	How can different security options reduce my expected losses, and at what cost?
	How are known threats impacting my system?
	Where do my corporate assets actually reside, and how do they contribute to my overall risk profile?
	How can I strategically prioritize my resources (people, tools, processes) where they will have the most impact?


Unfortunately, many executives don’t ask these probing questions. Instead, they throw the kitchen sink at a threat they don’t fully know or understand. Will the attack come in the back, front, or side door? Or, does the threat reside within? Executives should pause, get back to some basics, and ask the right questions before committing precious resources. As the old saying goes, “don’t send a battalion to take a hill when a regiment will do the job.”

The great military theorist Sun Tzu once said, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” However, “If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory you gained you will also suffer defeat.” And, finally, “If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

Applying this military philosophy in the cybersecurity domain and the boardroom is quite simple. Executives should identify their key vulnerabilities, their risk profile, and the latest information about external threats. Only then can they move forward with a strategy that informs decisions about financial planning, cyber defenses, risk mitigation, and business continuity.","

"Developing a Dynamic Approach to Digital Marketing","developing-a-dynamic-approach-to-digital-marketing","January 05, 2016","","Thomas Doggett","

Digital marketing is in the midst of a revolution. New tools, exponential increases in customer data, and a dizzying array of online and offline channels make it difficult to determine the best way to interact with customers.

If you’re like most companies, it’s important to diversify your marketing mix to ensure you have a presence wherever your customers go to identify, evaluate, and try potential solutions. But, unless you’re one of the lucky few with a massive marketing budget and team, you need to prioritize carefully to make sure you’re reaching your target audiences in the right place at the right time.

As marketing teams shoulder more responsibility for lead generation and become more integrated with sales teams, they also need to be more responsive to the sales pipeline. An agile marketing model—where activities are prioritized based on business needs and pipeline status—is the ideal approach in today’s fast-moving, competitive marketplace.

In this article, we’ll discuss how to develop a Dynamic Digital Marketing Strategy (DDMS). This approach will not only provide you with a flexible framework for prioritizing your marketing investments over time, but also a way to align your message and company with your business priorities and sales pipeline.

 

START WITH THE CUSTOMER, END WITH THE CUSTOMER

The good news is that one thing in marketing hasn’t changed: it’s important to focus on your customer. The foundation for a DDMS begins by having a very clear understanding of your target customer segments.

A DDMS requires that you take this understanding a level deeper by identifying what the customer is trying to accomplish at each step of their journey and where they go to look for the answer. For example, in the evaluation phase, most customers try to understand the range of options that meet their needs. They might start with a Google or Bing search and check out company websites. They’ll also probably evaluate customer reviews and get input through social media or by word of mouth.

If your company is new to a market or looking to grow your market share, a good starting point is how competitors are positioning themselves, and where. Still, many competitors are trying to figure out what works—just like you are. So, keep your eyes open for options that leverage the “one-to-many” influence of social media, communities, associations, and key influencers such as independent experts.

Once you have mapped the customer journey for each of your primary target segments, organize your marketing strategies into workstreams and determine where they have the greatest impact on the customer journey. This will allow you to focus on what levers to pull, and when—and adapt dynamically to business and market needs based on pipeline metrics.

Finally, determine where your company currently interacts with customers and identify any key gaps. You don’t have to fill all of these gaps immediately—start by filling the priority areas and measuring impact as you go. A true dynamic strategy allows you to focus on a small number of strategies at a time, as your business priorities and sales pipeline dictate.


FOCUS ON INNOVATION AND THOUGHT LEADERSHIP

Once you understand what your customers are trying to do at each phase of their journey and where they go to do it, the next step is to determine what to say to them, so you can engage them in conversation and establish your relevance as a trusted partner. Instead of just entertaining your customers with broad content marketing topics, focus your messaging on content that helps them solve their specific problem for each phase in the journey. Instead of a broad marketing strategy that relies on hope and air cover, get specific about what strategies and activities are most effective at getting you in front of the customer and communicating the right message at the right time.

 

SCALE THROUGH MARKETING AUTOMATION

Marketing automation can be a very effective tool for driving a customer journey at scale and measuring the effectiveness of a broad range of strategies and tactics at each step of the customer journey. The beautiful thing about this technology is that it can follow the customer on their individual journey, sending valuable content, tools, and calls to action when the customer needs it. It can also enable you to get very sophisticated with customer segmentation, message testing, measurement, and incentives—tailoring your interaction to the customer’s specific needs.

 

UNDERSTAND ATTRITION

Once you have done all the hard work to attract your customer, the worst thing you can do is to abandon them once they have their hands on your product or service. If you have a marketing automation system in place, you can quantify each of the attrition points along the customer journey and focus your efforts on mitigating the worst points first. The ability to quantify changes in attrition over time is crucial here in order to gauge where you are getting the best return on marketing investment (ROMI) and prioritize future investments and strategies. Don’t be afraid to test numerous strategies at the same time, in small batches. As long as you tag each campaign, you can measure them individually.

 

STAY CLOSE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS

If you don’t have marketing automation, focus groups and surveys are good ways to understand why you lose customers (make sure you make it worth your ex-customer’s time). You can also monitor online sites and forums to gauge why customers are dissatisfied and engage directly with customers to rectify the situation. In most of the research projects we’ve done, we see most of the challenges—and their solutions—within the first ten customer interviews.

Above all, the worst thing you can do is think you have the answers and disconnect from your customers. Engage your customers, partners, and industry experts to understand how customers are buying, which products and services they are using, and why. You’ll be surprised how often this changes in today’s digital world.

 

STAY FLEXIBLE

In addition to mitigating attrition points, another key component of a DDMS is driving customers to the next stage in their journey, based on your immediate business needs. For example, let’s say your sales team is telling you that a large portion of their pipeline is stuck in the evaluation phase of their journey. This indicates that you either need to change the strategies you are utilizing to move prospects through the evaluation phase, increase the volume of your investment in these strategies, or both. The good news is that you can fix what’s broken, measure it, and evaluate a number of options at the same time.

 

READY, SET, GO

Once you’ve developed a Dynamic Digital Marketing Strategy, present it to the key stakeholders in your company and get their commitment to follow the model. If they see that you’ve taken a data-driven approach that truly meets the needs of your customers, they’ll be more likely to buy in and stay the course as you test and optimize your campaigns.

To maintain their support, make sure you review the results of your DDMS monthly, and adjust your focus on specific phases of the customer journey—and your business—that need the most attention. This will allow you to accommodate change without changing your plan and losing momentum.","

"From Hierarchy to Wirearchy – Managing People & Change in the Digital World","from-hierarchy-to-wirearchy-managing-people-change-in-the-digital-world","November 18, 2015","","Cynthia LaRowe","

It’s a truism that the business world has changed. Digital technology is ramping up competition, disrupting industries, and blurring the line between the physical and virtual. At the same time, four generations bring different workstyles and motivations to the workforce—but all have common expectations for user-driven everything, social and mobile ubiquity, and a sharing economy. 

Traditional methods of managing people and change are falling short in the face of these seismic shifts in talent and technology. Command and control hierarchies are being overshadowed by “wirearchies” (a term coined by Jon Husband in 1999)  in which information is available on demand, and impact often comes from personal connection instead of organizational position. 

Whether they recognize it or not, most companies have wirearchy today. What differentiates industry leaders from others is how well they understand and leverage wirearchy to remain competitive in their markets and industries. What are the top ways to make the most of wirearchy in your business?

 

Democratize information and power-sharing

Top-down, bottoms-up, two-way—today’s top companies recognize that organizational structures are porous and that different power dynamics exist in interconnected networks. They encourage open exchange and influence through official and unofficial channels—inside and outside of the company. Zappo’s Culture Book is an interesting example. A collage of unedited employee impressions, the book is accessible and open to comment by the public online.      

 

Prioritize idea generation and innovation

Leading companies have always been characterized by knowledge, trust, credibility, and a drive for results. Today’s top companies build and reinforce these traits by setting expectations and visibly rewarding employees who champion and test ideas and who channel time, energy, and focus toward innovation. Google’s dedication of 20% time to employee-driven ideas is a recent, highly-publicized example. The company publishes and tracks the popularity of employee suggestions via an internal social tool called the “Google-o-meter.”  

 

Encourage employees to “swarm”

Modern employees expect the workplace to work like the rest of the world which uses crowdsourcing to make decisions and get things done. Top companies support employees self-forming into groups to solve client problems and provide collaboration tools to ensure their work and learnings are transparent—to clients, each other, and the company. Spotify Engineering works in loosely coupled but tightly aligned squads with end-to-end, release-to-resolution responsibility. Autonomous and cross-functional, they prioritize cross-pollination and internal “open sourcing” to learn quickly and create new solutions.

 

Shift from push to pull

Leaders in top companies plan on critical initiatives being driven at all levels. They include employees in creating compelling visions for the future and ensure that strategic objectives and metrics are clear. Employees with direct customer contact have significant decision-making influence and easy feedback mechanisms to retool strategies and metrics as needed. Famous for including empty seats at meeting tables to represent the customer, Amazon empowers employees to “make it right on the spot,” “working backwards” from customer needs to defined customer strategies, budgets, and programs.   

 

Embrace a culture of “perpetual beta”

Today’s top companies continuously adapt to survive and thrive in the constantly changing business world. They recognize that success lies less in a fixed way of doing things and more in flexibility, responsiveness, and agility to learn new ways to work. They support individuals “developing while doing” and reward “failing fast” with new challenges and opportunities. One of the first companies to publish its culture code online, Hubspot “seat shuffles” a large part of the company randomly every three months to reflect its credo that “change is constant” and to support “failing frequently [rather] than never trying new things.”

Wirearchy may sound radical, but in practice, people have always built and leveraged their own networks and if needed, worked around hierarchy to get things done. Wirearchy enables people to work together in intuitive and modern ways. Hierarchy is not dead in the modern business world—just repurposed from determining who commands and controls information to providing context for how decisions are made and governed across interconnected, interdependent, and highly innovative people, processes, and technology.

A different world, indeed.

"Planning for the Inevitable: A Proactive Change Approach","planning-for-the-inevitable-a-proactive-change-approach","November 18, 2015","","Tim Tow","Organizations seek change for many reasons—from adapting to changing business conditions or entering new markets, to gaining operational efficiencies. Whether it’s as simple as a new contract process or as radical as a new business model, landing change effectively and speedily is what separates successful organizations from the rest of the pack. 

Effective and speedy change doesn’t just happen by accident. It happens as the result of a thoughtful, proactive effort. Bridge Partners has helped many organizations land successful change initiatives and maximize the benefits of those initiatives using a structured change management approach. Framed by three objectives common to all change management efforts, we seek to:

1.  Decrease the dip in performance

2.  Shorten the duration of the dip in performance

3.  Increase the gains realized from change



Decrease the Dip in Performance

Studies show that with change management projects, there is an inevitable dip in productivity.  Impacted individuals contribute to this dip by the way they respond to change. The typical responses include:


	Denial – Believing that the impact of change is not applicable to them or their team
	Resistance – Continuing to operate “business-as-usual” or actively fighting change
	Exploration – Challenging new ways of doing business by comparing them to the old ways or looking for personal benefit
	Lack of Commitment – Not fully buying in and seeing how change benefits them and the organization


A fundamental component of change management is helping individuals see the benefits of change and identify and overcome the barriers they experience. It is critical to secure an executive sponsor to articulate the case for change. And that sponsor must be committed to the change themselves and have the credibility and rapport to get the organization aligned and individuals committed.

 

Shorten the Duration of the dip in performance 

To shorten the dip in performance, it is key to conduct a thoughtful examination of existing processes and a thorough impact assessment. Some common areas to explore during the impact assessment are:


	Scope – Determining the amount of change and the span of people, processes, and technologies affected
	As-Is/To-be Comparison – Identifying the major differences between the current state and the new state
	Risk Mitigation – Planning to address pitfalls and drawbacks during the change effort


The next step is to create a plan that mitigates the process impacts and delivers the future state in a measured way.

 

Increase the Gains Realized from Change

To increase the momentum of change, organizations should celebrate commitment and look for ways to continuously improve. Communicating successes and implementing a plan to measure the effectiveness of change can help them improve further and build positive momentum. Areas that are frequently neglected are:


	Measurement – Measuring the adoption and results attributed to the change
	Incentives – Ensuring impacted organizations and individuals are motivated to change
	Readiness – Identifying training and organizational alignment needed to enable and prepare people for change


In today’s environment, where technology changes rapidly and new markets emerge daily, reactive change is not enough. When change is too slow, too incremental, or, conversely, too big, it can paralyze organizations of all shapes and sizes. When that is the case, the costs often outweigh the benefits. To grow and adapt, successful organizations must practice intentional, proactive change.","

"Beyond Likes: Social Media that Drives Results","beyond-likes-social-media-that-drives-results","November 18, 2015","","","When Microsoft wanted to bring OneNote to the classroom, they chose Bridge Partners to connect with educators.
 



CHANGING THE WAY STUDENTS LEARN

Do you feel sentimental when you see a chalkboard or Trapper Keeper? They might take you back to your childhood, but there’s a good chance your kids have never seen either one in their classroom. More and more, educators are leveraging technology to connect with students. And according to recent research, parents, students, and teachers agree: innovation is a good thing.



HELPING TEACHERS WORK SMARTER, NOT HARDER

While teachers want and need better technology, it can be a challenge to find the right solution. Microsoft OneNote fills a void by bringing a new dimension of organization and collaboration to the classroom. Microsoft approached Bridge Partners with the challenge: introduce a transformational product to an underserved market segment. Bridge Partners led the social media campaign to connect with educators, an audience that may not proactively shop for software solutions, and drive traffic to onenoteforteachers.com.

Bridge Partners offered the experience and vision needed to craft the strategy as well as the tactical skills and subject matter expertise to drive the day-to-day operations of an integrated campaign. The team developed end-to-end campaign specifications and led content design, delivery, and analysis of the results.



“Bridge Partners provided valuable direction on how to deliver my OneNote content to the educator, while building out a robust editorial calendar to create a sustainable educator journey.” – Ari Schorr, Product Marketing Manager, Microsoft OneNote

EXCEEDING BENCHMARKS ACROSS THE BOARD

Bridge Partners digital marketing consultants worked to develop high-value content with copy and images that spoke directly to teachers. With compelling content, smart targeting, and the right platform, the campaign outperformed every benchmark by 2x across three categories. With more than 7 million educators who are active users, LinkedIn Sponsored Updates became the vehicle of choice. The platform is uniquely designed for professional development and the micro-targeting ability presented an attractive solution for the Microsoft OneNote team.

"Relationship Marketing: How Trust Works in a Digital World","relationship-marketing-how-trust-works-in-a-digital-world","October 21, 2015","","Richard Albrecht","I’ve previously written about the importance of understanding one’s customers and the power of branding in B2B marketing. One of the key elements of customer-centric marketing and long-term brand building is trust. A business’s ability to earn the trust of its customers is one of the most important factors of success for any business. Historically, personal relationships have been the most effective vehicle for building that trust and, eventually, brand loyalty. Today, most marketers are tasked with building trust through digital relationships, which brings both challenges and opportunities.

 

WHO DO YOU TRUST?

Recently, Nielsen research posted a study about trust in advertising. When asked what advertising sources they trust most, 83 percent of people say “someone I know,” and 66 percent say “opinions posted online.” Of course, most of us use trusted friends and colleagues for advice and product recommendations, but I find it interesting how willing we are to trust the opinions of people online. These are people we’ve never met—people who we may or may not trust in any other situation. This oftentimes misplaced trust leaves many customers vulnerable to the shady tactics of spurious marketers. Amazon’s recent lawsuit against fake reviewers is a perfect example of the importance of trust in the digital sphere. However, it’s also our willingness to trust that allows authentic brands to create a true value exchange and earn customer loyalty.

 

WHY TRUST MATTERS

Why is trust so important for marketers? Trust is a very important part of our interaction with the world. In our communities, in society as a whole, and in business, trust is the key factor that enables us to function and thrive. I recently read an article about key factors that enable trust in the March 2014 edition of Psychology Today. The key psychological driver of trust is an assumption that if you need help, you can turn to someone who will support you when you need it, coupled with a recognition that the support will be beneficial.

Marketers can use an awareness of this basic psychological construct of trust to build their brands, grow customer relationships, and go to market more effectively. Customers expect brands (consciously or subconsciously) to help them when asked, support an ongoing relationship, and make things right when they go wrong.  

Even in our highly digitized state, people tend to form better relationships in the real world than in the virtual world, so marketers must get smart about building and scaling their digital relationship engines. And it is hard to scale a relationship engine when our capacity for trusted connections is limited. For the nerds among us, I recently came across some interesting stuff on the limits of relationships and trust, based on our brain’s capacity to form bonds.

Marketers should take heed of the current thinking that posits that the digital ecosystem can increase people’s capacity to form trusted relationships. To succeed in today’s complex marketing environment, marketers must create a process to actualize trust across the digital ecosystem. Smart marketers will use that trust to build programs that drive sales, loyalty, advocacy, and referrals, which in turn create more trust in a virtuous relationship-marketing cycle.

 

HOW BRANDS BUILD TRUST

Here are three main elements that help brands build trust in a customer relationship and some examples of firms that have done this well.

1. Be authentic

In 2009, Domino’s was hit with a PR crisis that went viral. Two employees decided to film a prank in the store and post it online. It was a PR nightmare for the brand – reaching more than a million views before being taken down. Rather than a traditional press release apology, they released a YouTube comeback. The President of the company owned up to their mistakes, apologized, and announced new hiring practices.  They also started a Twitter account to respond directly to complaints. Customers will reward authenticity and transparency. Domino’s used digital channels to address a major crisis in a more authentic and transparent way.  

2. Give more than the sale

There is a reason millennials say Amazon provides the best customer service. Despite their negative press in recent weeks, you can’t deny their outstanding customer service. For millions around the world, Amazon is the trusted name in ecommerce. Why? Because they go beyond just sending you what you ordered. They are there when you need them.  They are quick to offer replacements, refunds, and recommendations. And they can keep their sense of humor in the process. Marketing doesn’t stop after the transaction. The relationship continues and so should your service.

3. Honor the relationship

The Starbucks Gold Card program has done more than transform mobile payments; they do a tremendous job adding value through relationship marketing. The program recognizes loyalty, provides relevant offers, and rewards purchases. Starbucks has done what every successful marketer needs to do: honor the unique relationship with each customer.

 

In conclusion, trust is a must-have for any successful marketer because trust is the primary psychological force that generates purchase intent and loyalty. Our unconscious minds won’t let us engage fully if something doesn’t feel right. And as we become increasingly facile with digital connections, those feelings apply to our digital interactions. Marketers have a range of digital tools at their fingertips, but none of them can generate a relationship without an understanding that trust is a two-way street.","

"Cybersecurity Leadership","cybersecurity-leadership","September 17, 2015","","Gordon Matlock","Protecting critical infrastructure for the State of Washington

 

In July, Bridge Partners welcomed cybersecurity and policy expert, Gordon Matlock, to our growing team. As Cyber Practice Lead, Gordon is charged with expanding Bridge’s cybersecurity and risk practice and developing relationships with firms looking to solidify their cybersecurity strategy and protect against security threats. Before joining Bridge, Gordon had a successful career as an advisor on intelligence, national security and the military. Recently, as a member of the Energy Sector Working Group, Gordon coauthored the Cybersecurity Guide for Critical Infrastructure for the State of Washington. Gordon will be presenting a “Cybersecurity and Your Utility” talk at the National Utility Training & Safety Education Association conference September 21-22 in Boise, Idaho.

 

As someone who is passionate about his home, I know that Washington is one of best places in the world to live, work, and play. As someone who is passionate about cybersecurity, I know that the safety and economic security of our beautiful state depend largely on the reliability of our critical infrastructure and the services they provide. With hacktivists, criminals, and nation-states now cooperating by sharing codes and tactics to attack, undermine, and exploit critical infrastructure around the world, it is imperative that Washington State critical infrastructure entities, of all shapes and sizes, do everything they can to detect, protect against, and mitigate cyber threats.  

Unfortunately, many of the critical infrastructure companies and providers from around the state simply do not have the resources to address this cyber threat head-on. In fact, many of these small to mid-size enterprises don’t know where to begin or how to prioritize their cyber spending.  They struggle to identify tools, information-sharing groups, and resources that are available to them from the state and federal government.

Knowing the importance of protecting the state’s critical infrastructure, I joined a self-organized group of cyber and policy experts. Our group recently produced the Cybersecurity Guide for Critical Infrastructure for the State of Washington with the goal of empowering these small to mid-size entities. By providing guidelines, best practices, tools, and resources for the critical infrastructure sector, we believe that we can help make our state more secure.

"Five Keys to Building a Compete Culture","five-keys-to-building-a-compete-culture","September 02, 2015","","Ezra Fain","

Every business has competitors and every customer has options. In fact, customers have more options and access to more information than ever before. Still, not all companies recognize their position in the market or understand how to emphasize their points of competitive differentiation. They tend to plan for growth without ever stopping to ask if and how they can outpace their competition.    

Through our client engagements, we’ve learned that whether your firm is in an emerging industry or in a well-established market, building a compete culture is a critical element of long-term success. This goes beyond tracking your competitor’s go-to-market strategies, understanding your points of differentiation, or analyzing how your market share is trending (all of which, by the way, are absolutely crucial). After identifying and capitalizing upon marketplace trends, a compete culture celebrates and rewards competitive gains. 

Does your business embrace competition? Or is it at risk of losing market share? Here are the five keys to building a compete culture.

1. POSITION COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE AT THE CORE

Market share performance and competitive insights should be foundational to every sales or marketing executive business review. Start by measuring the performance of your largest and most strategic products and services versus your primary competitors. Small changes in market share can be an early warning system for larger impending trends.  Next, look at early adopters. Share of early adopter customer segments can be telling of future market trends. When possible, measure competitive market share in terms of usage, users, services, or units in lieu of revenue. Revenue measurement can be skewed due to pricing, investments, product mix, and other factors.  

2. PLAN TO WIN

Too often, shortsighted, insulated business plans leave firms bound to lose market share in rapidly expanding categories. Start by defining your primary products and services. Then, with those in mind, align your business to a set of priority competitors. This will help you develop financial and scorecard plans that emphasize market share and consider the competition. Next, develop marketing and sales content grounded in the points of differentiation most relevant to your targeted customer segments. Review progress against these competitive plans as a core tenant of your business rhythm. 

3. BUILD A COMPETE COMMUNITY

Any authentic culture must be born from a strong sense of community. This is why every business should build a community of internal stakeholders and external partners focused on uncovering competitive insights, surfacing risks, and sharing best practices. This can be achieved through online social communities or forums, formal training programs, and learning events like competitive workshops. A strong compete community can help you identify weak market signals that have not yet surfaced in market share tracking and will enable you to respond faster to new opportunities and emerging threats.

4. REWARD A CULTURE OF WINNING SHARE 

If you successfully build a compete community, your next step is to design recognition programs that reinforce your culture. This requires executive commitment and constant communication. It is important to publicly reward market share gains and competitive wins to keep your teams focused on outperforming the market, rather than their previous performance or own expectations. These recognition programs can reward competitive marketing campaigns, marquee sales wins, successful service implementations, or the retention of key clients.  

5. OPERATE TO WIN

Successfully building a compete culture is a huge accomplishment, but it won’t mean much if you can’t operate with a competitive mindset. Every part of your business must work to build their compete muscle.  

Marketing: Establish tracking for both explicitly competitive campaigns and implicitly competitive campaigns that compare key features.  

Sales: Your sales operations teams should understand where competitors are in your accounts, which clients may be at risk of defecting, and where your net new customer opportunities lie. Understanding how your company wins and why your company loses is paramount.

Customer Service: Services teams should also be equipped to flag clients at risk of defecting and should be rewarded for their clients’ ongoing usage of your products and services.  

WRAPPING IT UP

Is your business positioned to discover and capitalize on the next market opportunity? Or will it stand by as its competitors exploit an ever-changing marketplace? These five key elements of a compete culture will enable a richer understanding of how your firm can outperform the market and could be the difference between being the hunter or the hunted. ","

"Putting the Drama in Project Management Part 3","putting-the-drama-in-project-management-part-3","July 23, 2015","","Cristofer Munson","

In Part One, I discussed the importance of having a concept of the final project outcome, and also a concept of how project execution can influence that final outcome. In Part Two, I explained how great project managers and great directors engage with each team member and support them in doing their best work. Today, I’d like to conclude this series by talking about why an effective project schedule is more than just a series of dates.

PART THREE: MOVING FROM DEPENDENCY TO COALESCENCE

While I hope it hasn’t happened to you, I’ve had my fair share of projects delayed or cancelled for a host of reasons (e.g., a higher priority project took over, the software development schedule accelerated, or business leadership changed). As I reflect on my theater experience, however, I realized that I have never had an opening night delayed or cancelled. Certainly, there are times when a cast and crew wished they had more time to be ready, but in most cases opening night arrives and “the show must go on!”

Whether you are a project manager or a theater director, you must create a project schedule that ‘works’ for the goals of the project. That’s basic. What I learned over the course of my brief life in the theater, however, is that the real trick is to craft a project plan that considers the coalescence of the different components of the production. A successful opening night is not just dependent upon great actors; rather, it is the culmination of multiple disciplines that execute the details of their work independently but must unite together at the right time. A smart director understands both the creative processes and logistical steps needed to ensure that the actors, the sets, the lights, the sound, the costumes, the crews, and the ‘everything else’ all converge at the same time. They must be ready, trained, and tested for the ‘go live’ that is known as ‘opening night.’

A project manager has the same responsibility. The project plan is intended to ensure that everyone working on the project knows what they need to do, and when they need to have it done. Very often, though, the who, what, and when overshadow the why. When that crucial step is ignored, individuals and teams can miss the opportunity to see how their work fits into the broader scope and context of the plan. They won’t see how the different parts and deliverables of the project coalesce into a greater, more important whole. 

Too many times I’ve shown up to test a new system only to find out that the test logins haven’t been set up yet. That’s because no one told the person responsible for system security why the test logins needed to be ready on that date. Now, admittedly, as a project manager you’d think it would be a safe assumption that if you need logins on a certain date, it’s because you want to use them on that date. That’s clear, right? Well, it may be clear to you why that date is important, but if the people doing the work aren’t privy to the broader picture and how their work fits into it, no assumptions are safe. 

BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER

If you are intentional in developing and articulating your overall concept for the project, attentive in communicating to team members in a manner meaningful to their role on the project, and artful in creating a plan that demonstrates how all the pieces of your project coalesce into a greater whole, you have the opportunity to do something truly remarkable. You can collaborate with others while leading them on a journey they otherwise would not have experienced. This is the essence of theater. This is why I enjoy designing and managing projects and programs in the business world. Project Management is, indeed, a creative act.","

"Putting the Drama in Project Management Part 2","putting-the-drama-in-project-management-part-2","June 15, 2015","","Cristofer Munson","

In Part One, I discussed the importance of having a concept of the final project outcome, and also a concept of how project execution can influence that final outcome. This time, I’d like to cover what I consider the secret to a great show (and a great project).

PART TWO:  WHY IT DOES MATTER WHO IS CAST AS BATMAN

I studied under a director who had quite a few Broadway credits to his name. When I asked about the secret to creating a great show, his answer was clear: casting. “Ninety-percent of your show’s success is based upon who you cast.” Having the right person in the right role goes a long way to creating a play or film that audiences love. Look no further than the Batman franchise to see how casting can contribute to the success or failure of a production. 

The term casting typically refers to the long (and sometimes agonizing) process of auditions, interviews, callbacks, and readings. In addition to casting the right actors, the director must fill other key roles including set, lighting, and costume designers. These roles also play a critical part in creating and delivering a production. With the play’s concept and approach firmly in mind, the director works hard to understand the strengths of each potential team member and considers who will be best in each role and who will work best with the rest of the team. 

Project managers are charged with a similar task and use all available resources to identify the best talent for their projects. This means contacting past team members, leveraging professional relationships, and working with recruiters. A mindful project manager not only thinks about putting the most talented person into each individual role, but also considers how the different team members will work together. I have known many directors who will forego casting a certain actor (thought to have had the “best” audition) because they sense that actor will be a burden to the team or a barrier to achieving their best work together. I consider the same team dynamics when I put together a team of consultants. 

In a perfect world, a project manager will have an endless supply of talented people to cast in the project. Needless to say, no world is perfect and, more often than not, a project manager has a team assigned to or assembled for them. The same is often true in the theater world and, fortunately, a good theater director has many tools in their tool bag to manage the situation. Theater is a multi-disciplinary art form and requires a diverse set of talents to bring everything together. A director must be keenly aware of the activities and responsibilities of each of those roles. They must also understand the considerations and constraints that impact the individuals in those roles. With this perspective, the director is able to communicate and work within a context that is meaningful to each individual. It is the director’s responsibility to clearly communicate what is needed from each of these different team members and ensure they understand how their work fits into the overall production.  

Just like a theater director, a great project manager engages with each team member in a manner that is relevant to them and supports them in doing their best work. The considerations and constraints of the software development team, for example, are different than those of the marketing team. The project manager is the point of synthesis between these different disciplines and perspectives. He or she either knows or learns the critical considerations and constraints of each role and works with all the team members to bring together a cohesive project. While he or she may not have selected specific team members, the project manager can increase the likelihood of reaching a successful outcome by communicating and working with team members in a manner that is relevant to their particular perspective.

I was involved in theater from a young age. I studied acting and directing in college and spent much of my twenties engaged in Seattle’s active theater scene. Several years ago, I had the privilege of being a guest speaker for a class of undergraduate business students at the University of Washington. During the Q&A, when I was asked what my major was, the class was surprised to hear that I had a degree in Theater. “How did a drama major get into the consulting business?” the class wanted to know. I told them matter-of-factly that I use the skills I learned as an actor and director every day as a consultant. 

In truth, all performance-related arts are project-related by nature. They require careful planning, thoughtful recruitment of talented people into different roles, and vigilant management of both time and budget if the final production is to be successful and the producing theater company to be sustainable. While I wasn’t aware of it at the time, every time I participated in a theater project, I was learning project management skills that directly translate to the planning and execution of projects in the business world.  

In this blog series, I will describe a few of the key principles that I shared with that class of business students and encourage project managers to consider on every project they manage.

PART ONE: ARTICULATE YOUR CONCEPT 

A good director has a concept for what the final production will be and, perhaps more importantly, the impact they want to make with that production. Some of these are given: is the play a comedy, a drama, a musical, or something avant-garde? Each genre has its own conventions which shape the show. Beyond that, though, the director’s palette is wide open. What is the mood of the show? In what period will it be set? What will the sets, lighting, and costumes look like? These decisions are typically made within the context of the overall concept for the show as well as the desired impact of the show.

The same is true of many projects in a business setting. By having a clear concept of the end product, the project manager avails themselves to the power that comes from telling a story. By painting a picture of the outcome, their team members can work to make that outcome a reality for their customers. Having a clearly defined concept and communicating that concept clearly and frequently helps to enroll everyone into the project vision and helps people understand that they are engaged in building something bigger than themselves. This taps into people’s passion and creativity and creates an environment where they are engaged in their work.  

Perhaps just as important as what the end product will be, however, is having a concept of how the creation of that of product will come together as a whole. When a director undertakes a new show, he or she considers the team environment they want to create to bring that show together. For newer works, when the script and end product is still in flux, the director may adopt a highly collaborative approach to rehearsals and production design meetings. If the timeline is tight, the director may adopt a very deliberate command and control approach. The director’s concept of the approach and environment he or she creates has a direct impact on the kind and quality of work being performed all the way up to opening night and throughout the run of the show. The mindful director is aware that the approach and tone they set for running rehearsals, running production meetings, and putting all the pieces together for the show directly effects the quality and the character of the end product. 

Mindful project managers understand this. The approach and tone they set for the execution of a project can have a tremendous impact to the final outcome. Project management is not a “one size fits all” proposition. A command and control approach, for example, is not always best, even if it helps the team meet deadlines. A project manager who leaves “dead bodies along the road” on every project will end up very lonely. By taking time to create a concept as to how it can all best work together, the project manager seizes the opportunity to be intentional in his or her approach.  And, as we know, much has been written about the power of intention. 

My experience in theater helped me understand that managing a project is, in its own way, a creative act. To be clear, not every project is a “Hamlet” and not every project will change the world. Regardless, if it’s a project worth having a project manager, then it’s a project worth having a clear vision of what it needs to achieve and of how it wants to achieve it.

"Marketing Automation: Consistency Counts","marketing-automation-consistency-counts","May 05, 2015","","Nathan Wright","

This isn’t your standard marketing automation blog post. I’m not going to restate a list of statistics about the explosive growth of marketing automation (you can find these with a simple Bing or Google search). I’m not going to give you the top five, seven, or eleven ways to generate more leads than ever. And I certainly won’t try to convince you that one platform is better than the others. Instead, I’m sharing some of my own best practices to help you get the most out of your marketing engines.  

For me, the single most important factor for deploying effective global marketing automation campaigns is consistency. Deliver consistent campaigns across all your markets and teams and you win. Yep. That’s it. Consistency of workflows, terminology, and best practices. Do this and you’ll improve your ability to replicate, execute, and coordinate across borders, business units, and teams.  

This is, of course, easier said than done. Delivering consistency is incredibly difficult in the modern enterprise given the general lack of time to plan, challenges communicating across time zones, shifting priorities, conflicting goals, and more. There are, however, a few things you can do as a marketing automation leader to deliver more consistent marketing campaigns, even in a hyperscale global enterprise.  

STANDARDIZE CAMPAIGN WORKFLOWS AND PROCESSES

Someone once told me that all processes are perfect – you get out of them exactly what they were designed to produce. If you want something different from your process, you need to change the process. Great marketing automation is defined by efficient workflows and effective processes. Your campaigns will run precisely as they are programed. One of the easiest ways to begin driving consistency across your campaigns is to focus on documenting the workflows and processes that drive the outputs you desire. Start by asking yourself a simple question. What is our buyer’s journey? Documenting your buyer’s journey is a great way to see if what you are getting out of your campaigns is aligned with what is going into your campaigns. My guess is that you will find some interesting gaps and opportunities. 

ALIGN TERMINOLOGY ACROSS GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED TEAMS

One of the most basic things any marketer can do to drive consistency and effectiveness is to standardize terminology. When you work across globally distributed teams, it’s especially easy for words to lose their meaning, be misconstrued, or simply be misunderstood. Without standard terms, definitions, and understanding, you are literally speaking a different language. Take the time to standardize the key terminology used by all your marketing operations teams and work to drive consistency in how they are used. If this seems too obvious, just ask yourself if you ever felt like your global teams didn’t understand what you meant. If so, you probably have room to improve in this area as well.

SEEK AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES

One of the greatest gifts I have working as a consultant is access to the many ways businesses create action to drive results. Some companies are better than others, but through trial and error, over time the great ideas become best practices. Sharing best practices across globally distributed teams is a simple and effective way to learn from others what works. It’s free learning and can help build highly effective marketing organizations. It’s easy to start, too. During your next meeting or monthly team conference call with your global marketing teams, take a moment to listen to ideas being shared and ask for what works and why. Then, document it and share it back for all the group to benefit. I’m always delighted when I hear teams sharing ideas and best practices with teams from other countries. 

Like most things in business and in life, you will get as much out of marketing automation as you put into it. If your goal is to automate for the sake of automation, you can purchase a solution and use it to run a few campaigns. You might see a return on that investment or you might not. However, if your goal is to truly harness the power of your new marketing tools, you will need to establish consistent workflows, terminology, and best practices. If you do, I’m certain you will see results.","

"Turning the Dial to ‘Always On’ Sales Readiness","turning-the-dial-to-always-on-sales-readiness","April 29, 2015","","Todd Vold","

The move to the cloud is a fundamental shift that makes business both easier and more difficult at the same time. Businesses must adapt to a new set of challenges and capabilities that simply didn’t exist before. Taking cloud products to market poses unique challenges that today’s sales leaders must address. 

Cloud products present fantastic new opportunities for the business and for customers. They also present unique challenges for even the strongest sales organizations for the following reasons:

Product release cycles are shorter than ever.  That means new features are constantly coming online. Sometimes sales teams know about them. Sometimes they don’t. 

The competition is changing just as fast.  Just because you knew how your solutions stacked up against the competition a month ago doesn’t mean that you know how they measure up today. 

Training and readiness content can become obsolete almost as soon as it is created.  If you’re still relying on traditional field readiness vehicles, you’re probably not moving fast enough. 

Engineering teams are continually expanding and improving your cloud solutions to stay ahead of the innovation curve and ahead of the competition. The challenge is, the rate at which they move typically surpasses the rate at which readiness teams can generate content.  

BE READY TO WIN

Sales readiness programs have been around for a while. They are intended to prepare sales teams for tough customer questions.  It’s a safe bet that if your teams have the right answers to tough questions, they will win more deals. But traditional readiness programs rely on point-in-time activities (e.g. hosting a class or publishing a piece of collateral). For your teams to keep pace in a rapidly changing environment, you will need to embrace an ‘always on’ approach to readiness programs. ‘Always on’ programs produce content that is concise, created by a cross-functional team, and current. 

CONCISE

Field sellers don’t have a lot of time. They want information that is easy to consume and digestible. Valuable content includes information such as: your current product roadmap and that of your competitors, messaging and positioning statements, ROI data points, customer case studies, FAQs, etc. Creating content like this will require your organization to build a new information architecture for readiness that favors bite-sized content. 

CROSS-FUNCTIONAL 

Product Management, Product Marketing, Incubation Sales, Engineering, and Professional Services teams all possess subject matter expertise. But these teams get bombarded by information requests from all across the organization. This can drain time and resources. The challenge is to build tight-knit relationships between these organizations so information can be quickly distributed to sales teams through efficient readiness channels.  

CURRENT 

In most organizations field stakeholders need to monitor many channels to stay current. To help them stay up to date, the enterprise needs to reduce the number of vehicles and optimize the ones they use.  Here is how:

Corporate Websites. You need a team or an individual to actively manage your corporate websites. This is probably the first place your field sales teams and customers go for information. Your web content needs to be current and cohesive. 

Mobile-First Vehicles. People use their mobile devices to find information, especially when they are on the move. Building mobile apps, mobile sites, and leveraging responsive design will help you deliver sales readiness content when and where it is needed most.  

Social Communities. Your subject matter experts work all across your organization.  Creating an online forum will facilitate discussions across functional areas and business units. This allows the best and most current information to flow freely throughout your enterprise. Before launching, make sure you seed the community with high-value content and actively promote and moderate the discussions. 

‘Always on’ readiness programs deliver the most current, most effective deal support possible. With quick and easy access to bite-sized content, your sales teams will be armed with the information they need to stay ahead of the competition and win more deals.

"Perspectives from the Pitch: Building Strong Teams","perspectives-from-the-pitch-building-strong-teams","April 06, 2015","","John Tribble","

I enjoyed playing sports when I was young. Unfortunately, my skill didn’t always match my enthusiasm. While sports came naturally for some of my friends, I had to work hard to develop my skills and knowledge in order to earn playing time. From that vantage point, it was easy for me to tell the difference between the coaches who were adept at developing talent and those who just relied on good athletes to win games. I vowed that if I ever became a coach, I would work hard to polish every diamond in the rough and get the most out of every player on my roster, regardless of their natural ability. 

These days, I’m trying to live up to that vow as a youth soccer coach. I have enjoyed a few personal rewards such as creating a bond with my kids and the families of the other players. What I didn’t expect was that coaching would give me a fresh perspective on business consulting. Here are three coaching principles I apply as a manager:

Invest time in team building.  When things don’t go right on the field, it’s natural for players to take it personally. They might feel like their teammates don’t like them or want to hog all the glory. To combat this, I started having the kids share their personal life with the team. We discussed their favorite vacations, how many pets they had, or what they appreciated about their teammates. As a result, they started trusting each other more, and when a pass didn’t come their way, they didn’t assume their teammate was ignoring them. I have also noticed that business colleagues that invest time building relationships—with their peers, within their team, or between groups of stakeholders—are better equipped to overcome adversity. They won’t assume the worst intentions when things go off track. Instead, they’ll work together, realizing that there is enough credit to go around when the group achieves success.    

Communicate your approach.  In soccer and other youth sports, one of the most important (and, at times, challenging) groups of stakeholders are the parents. Over the years, I’ve learned to proactively communicate what they should expect throughout the season, which might translate to “managing up.” What is my philosophy on balancing coaching-to-win vs having fun? How will I structure our practices? On what basis will I allocate playing time? How should we judge whether a season was successful or not? Letting the parents know in advance what will guide my decisions can reduce their anxiety levels when they don’t agree with what happens on the field. In the business world, communicating your approach for tackling a project (or how you want someone else to approach a project) is just as critical as the goal itself. The scope, timeline, or desired outcome might change, but if everyone is aligned on the approach, the process should result in a successful learning experience.    

Sweat the details.  I start every season focusing on the fundamentals of passing, shooting, and dribbling. I watch footwork to ensure each player knows the basic skills they will need to advance. I explain why these fundamentals are important in the context of a real game. I also spend time explaining the role of each position on the field, so that each player knows what is expected of them. We create a culture where the details are important, and players start to gain satisfaction from doing each individual task the right way. They might not realize it, but I am preparing them to scale and handle multiple, complex in-game scenarios that unfold in rapid succession. This translates to business in many ways. When onboarding a new coworker, what fundamental skills are non-negotiable? What do they need to learn before they are thrown into a complex project? How do you define return on investment for your organization? What level of stakeholder alignment is required to launch an initiative? If you are asking them to “manage a program,” can you break that down into a clear scope of components so that you and your coworker are on the same page? Your team should know what questions need to be answered, and what level of detail is expected. These are the fundamentals that strong teams emphasize from the start.  Whether you are a coach or a manager, no detail is too small.  

No matter what your profession is, it’s critical to have an outlet that helps you maintain perspective and work/life balance. For me, that outlet has been soccer. I’m fortunate that coaching has also provided learning opportunities that have made me a better consultant and manager.

"What’s Your Value Chain for Cloud Transformation?","cio-whats-your-value-chain-for-cloud-transformation","March 21, 2015","","Jerry LeishmanDan Quigley","
ANALYZING TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP

You’ve probably read about how moving to the cloud can lower total cost of ownership (TCO) by reducing the upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs associated with traditional IT services. Too often, though, decision makers analyze IT costs independent of other organizational functions (marketing, sales, etc.). As a result, they fail to account for the cost savings of related upstream or downstream services. Like the old joke says, when you base decisions off bad data, you make bad decisions with certainty.   

SCENARIO 

Let’s consider a common scenario where an IT organization is trying to determine if it is more cost-effective to replace an on-premise e-mail service with a cloud service. The CIO can’t reach a conclusion by simply adding up licensing costs and comparing that with the subscription cost. He must stop and ask how much time his engineers spend with the following: 


	Software and hardware development, testing, setup, installation, deployment, and support
	Complex customization and end-to-end system integration
	Business requirements and process definition
	End user training for internal and external customers and partners


These costs are also expected when standing up a cloud e-mail service, but they are probably not equivalent because the effort is shared between the customer and the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The total cost of ownership calculator from Software Advice can help you analyze TCO for on-premises software systems and compare them with cloud offerings. The calculator offers a solid start, but isn’t comprehensive. It fails to account for upstream and downstream impacts to related services. 

To find efficiencies within IT spend, you must first have access to the right information. Often times, CIOs fund projects based on the outcome of annual planning drills that follow a strategic roadmap. But creating business value and competitive advantage requires more than a strategic roadmap. This leads us to the value chain. 

THE VALUE CHAIN

In the mid-80’s, Michael Porter introduced the value chain as a tool for creating competitive advantage. He identified a generic set of interrelated activities common to a wide range of firms. Primary activities included Inbound Logistics, Operations, Outbound Logistics, Marketing, Sales, and Service. Secondary activities included Procurement, Human Resources, Technological Development, and Infrastructure.
The value chain can help analyze the delivery of any mix of products and services to an end customer. By mapping and analyzing the upstream and downstream impacts of a specific activity or service along the value chain, there is opportunity to identity and exploit efficiencies. 

SCENARIO CONTINUED

Let’s return to our scenario. Our CIO decides to perform an analysis of six major IT services for his 300-employee branch office. He assigns a relative business value and a TCO number to each service.




Assumptions:


	Email servers are installed and managed at a co-location hoster’s facility and connected to the branch office by an MPLS circuit. 
	Office is the preferred productivity suite and is volume licensed at eight dollars per employee per month. 
	Off-site backup is primarily for the email data and is charged as a separate service. 
	A custom customer support system application is being maintained in-house and housed in a data center in the branch office. 


The business value figures are relative to each other, with the highest rated service (Productivity Suite) receiving a value of 100—the business would simply not survive without it. Please note that there are several ways to accurately derive business value, but that’s a subject for another blog post. 

Bliss Factor:

The Bliss Factor is a simple “goodness measure” of what performs best based on your value criteria.  It is what gives you, the CIO, the most bliss and peace of mind. The actual bliss function (in this case a cost to value ratio) is not important. What is important is that you consistently apply a formula that accurately reflects the organization’s perceived business value of the services you provide.   

Once the TCO and business values are established, they can be plotted:



CHANGE IMPACT ANALYSIS

In this case, our CIO is examining whether or not he should move his email infrastructure to Office 365.  So, he re-analyzes the cost of delivering all services if he were to replace the volume license for Office with Office 365. A key element of this analysis is to determine if anything else he pays for changes. 

The first costs to go are the recurring license fees for Exchange, the equipment, and support staff. Next are the license fees for Office and the majority of those related delivery costs.

Since Microsoft automatically backs up email data, and charges for that service are built into the subscription, the business won’t need as much backup storage. Then again, since office 365 is hosted on Azure, perhaps the al-la-carte off-site backup service can be eliminated entirely and replaced with an Azure backup service. One benefit of cloud transformation is the value received from employing best-of-class services from focused best-of-breed experts. Another benefit is the ability to transfer operational risk and related costs to the vendor.

The MPLS circuit can be eliminated because the business no longer requires the security or bandwidth of a metro circuit to the co-location vendor.  IT can beef up the more cost-effective business internet connection to handle the increased bandwidth.

Bandwidth spend, particularly in companies with heavy customer engagement and/or widespread geographic locations, should be a top concern for the CIO. If the company has a large-scale legacy WAN setup (multiple hardware and software vendors, multiple carriers, and all the related infrastructure and support requirements), it will realize significant cost savings by switching to a global cloud service.
Returning to our value spreadsheet, there are two things that jump out. First, we see the expected cost savings with email and Office. Second, we see a pleasant surprise with the perceived business value of email—it as increased!



When polled, employees rated the business value of email higher, because of an improvement in availability. While the old email system was meeting reliability measures, it was down just enough to impact its perceived value.

Oh, and take a look at your Bliss Factor!



CONCLUSION

Once value has been analyzed and contributing parts identified, other models can be used in conjunction with the value chain to assess opportunities to create competitive advantage and reduce costs. CIOs need to decide how they will adopt the cloud and transform their IT organization. This means driving change for their internal customers and increasing business agility. 

Our next blog post will discuss how to transform your IT organization into a cloud service provider while accelerating business change and time to market.

"How Marketing Leaders are Moving to the Cloud","how-marketing-leaders-are-moving-to-the-cloud","March 12, 2015","","Rebecca Jones","

Have you recently sat in a meeting trying to redefine your customer experience? It’s a crucial challenge facing the majority of our clients, especially those taking advantage of cloud capabilities to create new subscription-based business models. These companies have embraced digital platforms to open up new segments and drive cost-effective demand gen. Their marketing and business leaders are in the midst of rationalizing a sea of multi-touch, multi-dimensional opportunities to engage with their customers. Here’s a snapshot of the changes we see our clients making in their marketing organizations as they move to subscription models.
 

EVOLVING MARKETING INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Digital tools create cost efficiencies to enter new markets and acquire new customer segments.   If you’re also introducing new business models, such as a subscription version of your product or offering, your investment strategy must evolve. To create a dynamic customer experience and deliver the business value of a premium-priced subscription, you’ll need a clear engagement plan. This plan should connect product marketing, digital marketing, inside sales, direct sales, and your channel. Most of our clients have invested in a marketing automation solution to drive more cost-effective demand gen. Now, they’ve turned the dial on how to engage with these tools in a meaningful way and ensure that they have a revenue performance blueprint that is connected, practical, and can deliver not only on the initial acquisition, but also the renewal lifecycle.
 

REDESIGNING A CUSTOMER JOURNEY THAT DOESN’T END WITH THE BUY BUTTON

If you’ve recently added a subscription offering within your business model, you’re likely evaluating where your marketing and sales activities end and where your customer service begins. What metric are you driving? What marketing tactics do you own?  Where do your accountabilities lie? We’ve embraced the fact that the customer journey is not linear. It’s fueled by self-directed customers who want to consume content when and where they choose. As a result, our clients are rethinking the customer experience and coupling digital engagement plans with the ‘always on’ customer relationships inherent to subscription models.
 

RATIONALIZING DIGITAL AND PHYSICAL TOUCHPOINTS 

Without a doubt, there is tremendous opportunity through digital and online platforms. However, to build a modern customer experience, our clients are realizing they must get back to the basics and understand their target customer and their buying profile. They are asking where their customers want to engage and how they make purchase decisions. Will it be online, at an event, or in a physical location? These questions are valid, even if they are purchasing a subscription. Once you have this information, you can see how your customer’s perspective has evolved and how you can get back in their line of sight. 
 

WRAPPING IT UP

Moving a product or service to the cloud creates a variety of new challenges and endless opportunities. This is why we see leading companies evolving their investment strategy, redesigning the customer journey, and working to rationalize customer touch-points. Smart marketers recognize that they must adapt to survive in the digital age. ","

"How to Put Customers First in a Digital World","how-to-put-customers-first-in-a-digital-world","February 26, 2015","","Richard Albrecht","

One of the most impactful lessons I learned in my business school days came courtesy of Dr. Daniel Turner, award-winning MBA Marketing Professor at the University of Washington. He said, “Think marketing, because that’s where the money is.” What I took from that quote years ago rings as true today as ever. If you don’t know your customers, you won’t have a business. 

The trust economy enabled by the internet has changed the focus from brand-based trust to personal trust. Today’s marketers must, in turn, shift their thinking. They are challenged to go beyond mere communication and create valuable customer connections. To be successful, companies must evolve from simply communicating a brand promise to truly living that brand promise with customers across all interactions. At Bridge Partners, we are finding deep customer connections to be more important than ever—for our clients’ businesses and for our own. We believe that modern marketing strategy is about building value-driven customer relationships. 

Techniques and tools for customer acquisition and retention evolve constantly. Digital tools have made it easier for companies and customers to engage, and companies must now leverage that capability to be responsive to their customers’ individual needs. According to Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, “If you are not linked to your customers more deeply and adapting more rapidly, you are making a mistake.”  

Today’s marketers have at their fingertips an exponentially growing ecosystem of digital tools to acquire, retain, engage with, and learn about customers. However, a digital tool is only as good as the customer relationships it enables. As face-to-face interactions get replaced and digital noise clutters the marketplace, customer relationships suffer, and marketers must work even harder to create context and connection with customers. This “context relevance” is the latest, digital age version of Dan Turner’s “know your customer.” 

To compete, companies must bring technology, marketing, and customer experience together holistically. Marketers should take ownership of customers across the buying lifecycle and put individual customers at the heart of their strategy. Contextual marketing is all about using digital tools to enable trust and create compelling customer relationships and dynamic, personalized experiences. 



With so many customer touchpoints, businesses of all kinds must begin thinking of themselves as services companies. Every customer interaction, pre and post-sale, is a measurable opportunity for interaction with a brand promise. Technology enables more effective marketing programs and, if used wisely, can create more relevant and valuable customer connections. Smart companies need to take advantage of the opportunities for closer customer connection, and smart marketers must lead the way.

"Why I Joined Bridge Partners","why-i-joined-bridge-partners","February 18, 2015","","Robin Nirken Berson","

For today’s workers, changing jobs can be as frequent of an occurrence as changing hairstyles. They bounce from job to job, looking for the next opportunity to enhance their resume or jump to a higher pay scale. I’m not suggesting that this is bad thing, but it does present challenges for employers. Some argue that this willingness to switch jobs is due to generational differences. Others argue that economic forces are to blame. Whatever the root cause, employers everywhere are faced with the same question: how do we retain our best and brightest? 

I’ve had the good fortune of shaping a career path that hasn’t followed this trend. I’ve changed companies only twice in twenty years—hardly the common model for upward mobility in the 21st century. What made me stay so long at these companies? How did I manage to steadily grow my career without grabbing every opportunity that presented itself? Maybe I’m just a loyal person. Maybe there was something special about the positions that I’ve held. Maybe I was simply lucky. Maybe it’s a little bit of all of these, but I think there is something more. Something that can help companies everywhere retain their best people. More on that in a moment. 

Last year, after twenty years in the workforce, I decided to step away from my career. I didn’t know if I was going to take a sabbatical or an early retirement. I just knew that it was time for a break. Once I had recharged my battery, I was ready for a new challenge. This meant doing something that I hadn’t done in a very long time: hunt for a job.  

Initially, the thought of joining Bridge Partners and launching a practice in Austin seemed like a huge step. But then, during the selection process, I spoke with CEO Richard Albrecht. He kept coming back to the priority he placed on people. He wanted people to be real, rather than just fit into a certain mold. I left that conversation knowing that I was joining a firm where I could be my most authentic self and build real relationships with the people around me. I had found something that felt familiar and that had worked for me in past successes.

When I reflected on my career, I saw that I had made it a priority to put myself in situations where my values were clearly aligned with those of my company. Because of this, I consistently found myself working with like-minded people. For me, that’s the difference between just clocking in for a job and feeling a sense of real connection.  

So, how can companies retain their best and brightest? Many people will say it’s just about values. Or culture. But people value different things and come from different cultures. Your company can’t be all things to all people. What it can do, though, is encourage people to live their values in an authentic way. Whatever your values, make them real. It’s the single biggest reason why I’ve stayed loyal to my employers in the past. And it’s the single biggest reason why I’ve landed with Bridge Partners in Austin.

"Help! Why Aren’t We Winning in the Cloud?","help-why-arent-we-winning-in-the-cloud","February 05, 2015","","Chase Morgan","

Moving your products and services to a cloud model is a big deal. Now that you have crossed that chasm and re-architected your product lines into cloud offerings, it’s time for your high-performing sales team to sell. But offerings are moving much slower than you and corporate stakeholders expected.     

What’s so different with selling cloud solutions? It turns out, a lot:


	Identifying the Customer
	Assembling the Right Sales Team
	Staying Smart


IDENTIFYING THE CUSTOMER

It is possible that your current customers are ideal prospects for your cloud offerings, but you are probably targeting new market segments, as well. In either case, the buyer is likely a business decision maker and quite possibly a contact that your sales team hasn’t called on in the past. IT and finance could either be part of that decision process or blockers to the sale. Your sellers need to know what drives decisions in target segments and how to spot prospects who are ready to jump to the cloud. Questions to ask: 


	How are you segmenting your market by industry, line of business, and customer size?
	How are you aligning your sales team for laser-focus on the buyers of your offerings? 
	Do you know your competitors and who they are calling on now? 


Whatever your cloud offering, it’s critical that you identify your buying audience, understand what drives their decisions, and know your competition. 

ASSEMBLING THE RIGHT SALES TEAM 

Great sellers can learn how to identify the new buyers, but they need presales technical support to accelerate the deal. Your customers will need clear technical answers about performance, availability, SLAs, migration plans, disaster recovery, security, privacy, and so on. Ensuring sufficient technical pre-sales capacity—whether with your own FTEs or through partners—will ensure the conversation is focused on the long-term value of the solution rather than the blockers for deployment. Questions to ask:


	Have you assessed your sales strategy and the skill mix needed to move your cloud offerings? 
	How does this change your sales methodology and orchestration? 
	Is your channel strategy working for you? 
	And, finally…does your compensation model reward the sales model changes?


Now that you've identified your buyers and you have the right sales resources in place, how do you stay ahead of rapid change and competition?  

STAYING SMART: “ALWAYS ON” TRAINING PROGRAMS

The velocity of change within the cloud solution environment can be overwhelming for anyone.  Your sellers (and marketers) need to not only pay attention to changes in cloud solution offerings, but to your offering’s position in an ever-changing competitive landscape. Sellers can no longer rely on quarterly meetings and email updates to stay current. To stay competitive, they need bite-sized readiness content delivered as close to real time as possible. And your sellers need a point of view on market changes. Your customers are counting on clear, accurate positioning of your offerings. It’s a perfect opportunity to become their new trusted advisor as cloud solutions mature. Questions to ask:


	What are the go-to information sources your customers rely on today?  
	How do your sellers stay current on industry issues impacting their customers’ businesses?
	How are you giving your sales team the ability to represent your offerings and partnerships in this turbulent landscape?
	Is your competitive strategy current and constantly communicated? 


We’ve entered a new era requiring innovative programs for field readiness and enablement. Communicating up-to-the-minute information can be the difference between winning a customer and getting left behind.  

These are a few of the crucial issues to address as you transform your legacy sales organization. If you can answer these questions, you are well on your way to driving success in the cloud.","

"Crafting the Right Content for Technology Buyers","crafting-the-right-content-for-technology-buyers","January 28, 2015","","Cindy Lavoie","

We help a lot of our B2B technology clients with go-to-market campaigns that typically start with an audience-focused message, a set of content deliverables to communicate that message, and a plan for measuring the effectiveness and ROI of the content. Unlike old-school push-marketing methods, content-driven marketing employs a more holistic approach by connecting buyer behavior, marketing messages, and actual sales results into a productive feedback loop.   

Most tech companies are joining the digital content marketing bandwagon in one form or another. And as tech companies get more skilled in this marketing approach, more nuanced insights and opportunities are starting to emerge.  We have a few insights of our own to share.
 

PLAN IN NEW DIMENSIONS

It’s always a good idea to start your marketing efforts with a plan. But content marketing requires new levels of planning. It’s still essential to define your target audience, know what challenges and issues they face, research how they’re influenced, and understand what value proposition will resonate for them. But that’s no longer enough.  

Today, customers are doing their own research online, before they even contact a vendor, and you’ll want to make sure your content is there when they go looking. This means:


	Developing the buyer’s journey as a key dimension of your marketing plan and creating appropriate content for every stage of that journey.  
	Adding search terms as another qualifier of your target market, since online searches are typically the first step in the B2B buying process.  
	Creating an editorial calendar, so you can manage the distribution of your content and gain exposure where it’ll have the greatest impact.  
	Planning your analytics upfront, so you’re able to track and measure in real-time and know what content and placements give you the biggest bang for your buck.


CATER TO THE STAGES OF YOUR BUYER’S JOURNEY

Content marketing requires a lot of content, but it doesn’t mean beating the same drum over and over again. It means paying closer attention to your buyer’s state of mind and making sure your content—and tone—addresses the appropriate concerns at each stage. While some companies identify as many as five stages in the buyer’s journey, we typically recommend a minimum of these three for a successful B2B content campaign:

Stage 1: Awareness. The buyer becomes aware of your brand or product and makes a connection to their own experiences, needs, or challenges. The best content for this stage is aspirational in tone, offers a promise or allays a fear, and establishes an emotional connection to your brand. This is a key starting point for establishing thought leadership.  Typical tactics for generating awareness are blogs, paid advertising, social media, contributed articles, and events.

Stage 2: Engagement. Once you’ve achieved awareness, the next stage is to engage the buyer’s interest. Content aimed at this stage needs to establish a clear and relevant value proposition, with a tone that is practical and engaging. This is where your marketing efforts can effectively make a case for your product. Tactics include case studies, email campaigns, webinars, white papers, and other educational materials.  

Stage 3: Purchase. Once the buyer has had practical or educational engagement with your offer, the next stage is to support final purchase considerations. This is typically where competition, price, peer recommendations, and implementation planning come into play. Marketing becomes more hard-hitting and informative in tone. Tactics can include sales presentations, TCO calculators, product roadmaps, and planning guides.
 



DESIGN FOR FORWARD MOMENTUM  

All content should ideally include some form of a call to action, designed to move the buyer forward through the stages of the journey and, ultimately, point them to a purchase location or contact. The website landing page can act as the content hub, with all content links mapped to the buyer’s underlying journey roadmap.
 

CONNECT SALES AND MARKETING WITH ANALYTICS

The ultimate goal of marketing is to increase sales of your products. This reality can sometimes get lost, but content marketing analytics allows you to bring it front and center. Marketers can get great value from the new marketing automation tools, since they offer exciting opportunities to track budget dollars all the way through to a closed sale.  

Technology companies often have a more complex link between marketing and sales – including direct sales staff, channel partners, events, and other elements that today’s automation software doesn’t easily account for. But don’t let this deter you from collecting metrics. We’ve worked on many campaigns that required manual accounting for sales leads, event attendees, and other trackable metrics. Even with cumbersome work-arounds and manual data collection, it’s still worth planning for analytics in every content campaign. Even when your metrics are not perfect, they’ll teach you a lot about how to improve for your next campaign. 

When done well, content-based digital marketing creates a process with data-driven feedback at every stage of the buyer’s journey and valuable insights to help you optimize your marketing and sales efforts.

"Look Before You Leap: Planning for Social Media Success","look-before-you-leap-planning-for-social-media-success","January 15, 2015","","Susan DoddsHeather Roscoe-Andersen","

It’s easy to understand why brands have jumped into social media. Low cost. Low barriers to entry. High visibility. While social media may sound simple, it’s important to remember that managing social media for a brand is very different than posting selfies and cat memes on your personal Facebook page. Brand marketing has broader considerations and implications. Without a savvy strategy, your efforts won’t result in a credible social media presence for your brand. 

Define your objectives 

Before you start creating social accounts, take the time to think about how your social media goals align with your business goals. You might ask: 


	What do you want to accomplish for your business?  
	Are you trying to gain more newsletter subscribers or registrations for your service? 
	Do you need to educate users about your software product or encourage them to walk into your retail store? 


A clear definition of your end goals will help direct your social media activities and keep you focused on what’s important.

Choose your channels 

Every objective requires that you carefully consider which social channels you choose. Not all channels are created equal, nor are the audiences who frequent them. While there may be some overlap, the intent and value derived from each is quite different. For example, LinkedIn is great for professionals seeking career, networking, professional development, or industry information. Twitter is an informative and entertaining source for current updates, while Pinterest is highly visual and inspiring, appealing mostly to female audiences (currently).

It’s critical to match your channels to your audience and to consider the value and message you are going to provide. It’s more effective to have a strong presence in a few, targeted channels than it is to spread your efforts across every possible social channel. Ultimately, it can be detrimental to your brand to create useless social pages that soon become abandoned. 

Craft your content

Social audiences are ravenous for good content, be it written, video, audio, or visual. Develop a solid strategy for providing valuable, thought-provoking material that will keep your followers coming back for more. Always consider: 


	Content type 
	Tone and voice
	Audience
	Frequency
	Timing 


Again, think about your goals and what you are trying to achieve. Are you trying to increase your audience size, engagement, product usage, or sales? If you’re tweeting three times a day and still not seeing results, then it’s time to evaluate how meaningful your content really is. 

Remember that social media engagement is a two-way conversation. Developing an authentic voice, while aligning the tone of your content to your company’s personality is important. You also want to carefully balance your message by providing calls to action without pestering your followers with a constant sales pitch. Positioning your content around the customer benefit and what helps satisfy their needs is usually the most successful approach. Pairing your content with an engagement strategy is also important to consider. For example, it’s important to consistently monitor the activity in your channels and interact with the community via replies, likes, comments, or @mentions, which can extend your reach and spur action.

Assemble your team

Finally, it’s important to be realistic about the amount of time and resources required to manage and run a social media presence for your organization. Even the best laid plans will fall short without the right resources in place to execute against the strategy and to ensure a healthy level of activity among your channels and communities. 
Your “team” can include one, many, or even part-time individuals, depending on the size of your organization or budget. The key is to clearly define roles, responsibilities, and expectations for each team member. 

For example, a great way to source rich content and product expertise is to establish a cross-functional team with representatives from across the company. Staying in regular contact with your PR and legal contacts will protect you from inadvertently making costly and embarrassing public mistakes in your social channels. Knowing what your product and design teams are working on can help you craft interesting messages and stories that your followers find valuable.

Putting it all together

Whether you’re getting ready to jump into social media for the first time or reevaluating your current strategy, take the time to consider these points: 


	Have a plan that answers these questions: What do you want to accomplish? Who is your audience? Which social channels will work for you?  
	Don’t underestimate the power of content. The web is inundated with noise and finding a way to stand out can be tough. Providing bite-sized pieces that speak to the customer value will resonate so much more than a sales pitch. 
	Identify dedicated resources. Make time, define roles, and get help from the broader team. You may work with colleagues from sales, engineering, PR, and more. So, remember that these folks are also creating customer value within their functional areas and be sure to take advantage of their expertise. 


Your brand has a lot to gain in the world of social media. When you have clear goals and deliver compelling content via the appropriate social channels, you can engage with your customers in a meaningful way. There will be challenges along the way, but if you start with a cohesive plan, you should make the leap with confidence. ","

"Cutting Through the Clutter: Visual Content Marketing","cutting-through-the-clutter-visual-content-marketing","December 18, 2014","","Tim Gunderson","The strongest B2B brands build personal connections with their audiences. This is one reason why so many companies are jumping on the content marketing bandwagon. Unfortunately, as that bandwagon nears capacity, it becomes increasingly difficult for content marketers to cut through the clutter. 

One of the most effective ways to stand out is to create bite-sized pieces of visual content that grab attention and support the brand. People love pictures. We’re going to take about one billion photos this year alone. Combine our love of snapping selfies with the fact that 65% of us are visual learners, and it’s clear why visual content is so valuable.

"Filling in the Blanks: Brainstorming With Yourself","filling-in-the-blanks-brainstorming-with-yourself","December 09, 2014","","Barbara Spear","

Nearly every writer I know has the same challenge: how to get started. It’s funny--whenever I’m faced with a first draft to write--how many ordinarily low-priority tasks suddenly need immediate attention. I’ve been known to polish the sink or clean my keyboard with a tiny brush instead of beginning to write. Especially in the face of a looming deadline.

So, how can you move past the virtual or real blank page and move forward with a project?

First: turn off your internal editor. Just write. Don’t interrupt your flow, especially as you’re just getting underway, by judging your results. Wait until you’ve completed a draft before you start editing.

Here are a few pragmatic techniques that may help you get your brain in creative gear.

Embrace the blankness. Grab a big piece of paper or a whiteboard. Start writing down everything that occurs to you, whether it’s related to the topic or not. Don’t worry about the order of what you write or where you put it on the page, even whether it’s upside down or written along the edge of the paper or board. Keep filling in the spaces until you’ve filled up the space and/or written down everything you can. At that point, read through your writing and use a different color pen to identify the most important points and their relationship with each other.

Seize the blank page (online version). Open a new document. Just start writing, whether it has anything to do with the topic or not. Copy and paste everything you have on the subject, wherever it may come from and in whatever order. To avoid copying other writers’ work, use a different color type for any content that you cannot use as written. When you’ve finished, read through the document and reorder it to tell the story. Use that version to create a working outline.  

And, if you’re still stuck, exercise your mind. Give yourself a short break for active, purposeful procrastination when you can focus on thinking about anything but the project. Get away from your workspace and do something different to change your mental channel. Take your dog, or just yourself for a walk. Make yourself a cup of coffee or tea. Solve a puzzle. When the break is up, zero in on your assignment.

One more technique: shift the subject. Work on something else and give that your full attention for at least ½ hour. Then, try again with the empty space technique above.

Most importantly: give yourself permission to rewrite. Don’t try to make your first draft perfect, but instead count on your revisions and additions to your first version. Be respectful to your goal: edit your work thoughtfully and don’t be afraid to throw out your first paragraph and begin with your second.","

"The PMO: Tax or Benefit?","the-pmo-tax-or-benefit","November 20, 2014","","Tim Tow","Many enterprises have established Program and Project Management Offices (PMOs) to provide oversight and accountability for projects, yet struggle to justify their value. Despite its prevalence, there are still many misperceptions about the role of today’s PMO. Unfortunately, project owners often perceive its oversight and accountability as a tax on their project. Project owners view their cooperation as a duty, not recognizing PMO involvement might be a benefit. So, to avoid being penalized, they adhere to the letter of guidelines set forth by the PMO with the same pained resignation with which they do their taxes. For those who understand the potential of an effective PMO, this attitude is frustrating. These project owners are missing an opportunity: a truly effective, strategic PMO isn't just overhead. It plays a crucial role in streamlining and orchestrating efficient projects. 

The Project Owner’s Viewpoint



A common refrain from project owners to the PMO is, “I'm driving real change here and all you do is tell me to tell you what I'm doing!”  This complaint is understandable. Most people don’t enjoy getting audited by the IRS, and that’s exactly how PMO requirements can feel to project owners. This perception arises because most corporate PMOs cover a broad spectrum of projects and efforts. That means they lack time or bandwidth to fully understand each project in context. Since they need to provide consistency in reporting, many PMOs rely on cookie-cutter project plans and regimented status updates. Some structure is essential, but force fitting everyone into one monolithic standard can be counterproductive.

Building a New Reputation

To change its negative reputation, the style and orientation of the PMO must change from dictating policies and structure to facilitating change. Facilitation involves being able to navigate among competing projects. To do this effectively, the PMO needs to understand the context for each project. Understanding the context helps the PMO align priorities and make sense of competing requirements.  A close sibling to facilitation is collaboration. A collaborative PMO is one that integrates with projects and seeks to offer opportunities to its project owners rather than merely demanding project statuses. 

Adding Value Through Service 

A PMO can provide oversight and accountability while also adding value for project owners. The strategic PMO will be a boon to its organization by ensuring project delivery is orchestrated collaboratively. The PMO should present opportunities to project owners, rather than just consolidating statuses and project plans. The consolidation of multiple project statuses for senior leadership, while important, should only be the means to an end. The PMO that adds real value is one that provides project owners with opportunities to get senior leadership or external stakeholder feedback and buy-in. These are contributions that will resonate with project owners.

To ensure it is adding value to the projects it is managing, a strategic PMO should focus on consistently providing these three services: executive visibility, dependency management, and issue escalation.

Executive Visibility – Set regular executive check-ins and structure these check-ins as working sessions for senior staff to weigh in on cross-project issues. 

Dependency Management – Identify dependencies across supporting functions (e.g. finance, legal, human resources) and between projects. Plan for those dependencies and understand the implications for all projects.

Issue Escalation – Track issues formally and visibly to ensure prompt resolution.

Do these well, and project owners will understand how the PMO can help them be successful.

"Framing a Conversation","framing-a-conversation","November 06, 2014","","Rebecca Jones","Selling a complex solution doesn’t require equally complex story telling. This is especially true when you’re hoping to advance a customer conversation one step closer to considering your solution, and ideally, moving from an evaluating to a purchasing state of mind.  

It’s not an easy task to frame up a conversation well and get to the strongest, simplest points. I’m reminded of how challenging it is when I assess how many times it took me to frame up this blog.

One of my back pocket tools is avoiding what I call a ‘frame within a frame’ when architecting a solid sales and marketing presentation. So just what do I mean by a frame in this context? A frame is the construct and glue to manage the collection of points in your story. 

Here’s a representation of a frame within a frame:

 

Notice in the image, it’s hard to know where to look and what path to follow. When you know a lot about a subject, it’s challenging to cut away from intricacy and focus the story on its most essential points. You’re effectively creating a mind-maze when you pop customers in and out of various frames. As you move your story among technology trends, solution areas, benefit trees that nestle consideration paths, campaign themes, and ideation concepts, your customer gets lost. When they have no idea what to attach to, customers likely forget, lose track of, or dismiss your story altogether because it’s simply too complex to navigate.   

One key to a well-constructed frame is the rule of three, which many studies identify as the ideal number of points to make.  You’ll want to use no more than three points to frame up your solution or service to make a relevant customer connection, differentiate from alternatives, and organize the key messages and proof points that deliver on your claims. If it’s done right, your customer can absorb the three most important points they need to remember.

More reading about the magic of 3?  Check this out: Three Is the Right Number for Persuasion

What does this mean in practice?  


	Spend over half your development time thinking about what you want to say and how you are going to frame your story. Complex stories don’t sell complex solutions.  It’s translating the value of the solution to relevant customer needs that will sell every time.    
	Entering into the conversation in a meaningful way is critical. It’s important to let you go of what you want to say and zero in on what customers want to hear and what they care about.   
	Don’t drink the Kool-Aid! Make sure your frame works. Bring in your sales team, let them trial it. They’ll let you know if it resonates and moves their customer conversations forward.

"Why Austin?","why-austin","October 30, 2014","","Richard Albrecht","


Recently, I was asked why Bridge Partners chose Austin as a keystone investment in our business strategy. The answer was simple. Building a presence in Austin represents a rare opportunity to contribute to one of the fastest growing economies in the nation and expand our business in a hub for technology, software, and manufacturing. 

There are strong parallels between the city of Austin and Bridge Partners. Like Bridge, Austin has experienced tremendous growth in recent years and continues to march to its own beat—grounded, creative, and just a little bit different from the rest of the pack. As business has boomed for both of us, Austin and Bridge have remained true to their roots. Just as the people of Austin take pride in a vibrant local culture, the people of Bridge Partners take pride in our uniquely personal approach to delivering results for our clients. 

Bridge Partners lands in Austin with an investment in tremendous local talent. Director, Robin Nirken Berson, is a local star with 20+ years of experience in sales, marketing, and management. Mary Rose Becker is an Austin resident and Texan with 20+ years of experience in marketing, sales, and operations with companies like Dell and Microsoft. Responsible for driving Bridge’s Austin business and strengthening our connection to the local community, Robin and Mary Rose look forward to carrying Bridge’s collaborative professional services model to Austin. 

At Bridge, we don’t have an army of cross-country robo-consultants. We hire local talent so that we can build relationships founded on trust, transparency, and collaboration. That’s why I’m so excited to grow in a city with a wealth of local talent. It means so much to us to be putting down roots in Austin, serving our Austin-based customers, and investing in the local economy. We at Bridge Partners are proud to be part of this dynamic city – a unique mix of the cosmopolitan and the home-spun at the leading edge of business.

"Let’s Get Personal: Building Better B2B Brands","lets-get-personal-building-better-b2b-brands","October 10, 2014","","Richard Albrecht","Everyone is familiar with the boatloads of money spent building consumer brands.  From Coke vs Pepsi to Nike vs Adidas, the battles between iconic brands are worth billions.  And when people think of branding, they immediately think of business to consumer (B2C) brands.  What most of us don’t realize is that branding can be even more effective and valuable with business to business (B2B) brands. 

B2B branding is not a new concept.  B2B marketers have been branding their products—even commodities—for decades now.  Some of us are old enough to remember the adage, “no one ever got fired for buying IBM.”  IBM’s customers themselves had unwittingly created one of the pillar themes of B2B brand loyalty, and sustained it for decades—a perfect example of old school branding aligned with today’s latest thinking.

Recently, things seem to have devolved a bit in the world of B2B marketing.  Most of the current B2B literature has, unfortunately, focused on ways to articulate functional differentiation. How to Brand Sand

B2C marketers, on the other hand, learned long ago that functional differentiation only takes you so far. Effective messaging taps into emotional needs and personal motivators. Consider these examples:  

If I were in the market for a new sports car, I could probably find a better buy than a Jaguar F-Type.  Still, this #GoodToBeBad commercial does an amazing job of making me forget what will be truly bad—the maintenance costs and hassles of buying an English-made sports car (apologies to the UK J). 



And even though I support showering, scientists have yet to link Dove body wash to higher levels of self-esteem.  That didn’t stop Evolution from taking the nation by storm. 



Despite the disconnect between these products’ functional attributes and their brand messages, these marketing campaigns have been successful.  Their brands appeal to personal emotional needs— status, adventure, and self-worth—in ways that transcend the nature of the products themselves.

B2B marketers often build brand messages around functional attributes, technical specifications, and business benefits. But new research by the CEB Marketing Research Council indicates that a B2B brand’s perceived personal benefits have twice the impact of its perceived business benefits.  Their research also finds that 68.8% of buyers who see personal value in a brand are willing to pay a higher price, while only 8.5% of buyers who do not see personal value are willing to pay a higher price.       

Why would managers in charge of purchasing decisions care more about personal value (professional advancement, social benefits, self-image, and emotional factors) than they would business value (performance, cost, and structure)?  Let’s go back a couple of decades to our IBM example. This apparent contradiction could be explained by the personal risk associated with purchase decisions.  A purchase decision can lead to a demotion or promotion, a slap on the wrist or a high five.  And when there are personal risks, even the most disciplined, numbers-driven manager will feel the weight of the decision.  This is why emotion cannot be ignored, and “no one ever got fired for buying IBM” was such a powerful paradigm.

But how do B2B marketers tap into these emotions to develop compelling, effective brand messages that create meaningful differentiation and, ultimately, lead to increased sales, loyalty, and brand equity?  The answers are found in commercial insights.  Real commercial insights begin with listening.  What is important to your customers?  What are their values?  What makes them smile and what makes them frown? They might not state explicitly their emotional needs and personal motivators, but if you read between the lines, you will find recurring themes amongst your customers.  

After developing that new level of empathy, it’s easy to point to the business challenges and pain points most closely related to your customers’ emotional needs and personal motivators.  If you’ve done this well, your messaging and functional attributes will work in harmony to drive results for your business.  

And if you’re lucky, like IBM, your customers will create their own brand adage for you.

"The ‘Aha’ Moment and the Power of a Story","the-aha-moment-and-the-power-of-a-story","October 10, 2014","","Cindy Lavoie","Storytelling is as old as the human race, but a few years ago it suddenly became a buzzword in marketing circles, alongside the explosion of content marketing.  Consumer marketers were quick to jump on the bandwagon, and blogs like Content Marketing Institute, Hubspot, and MarketingProfs built large followings by advising marketers on how to create value, publish it through content, and build social buzz to promote brands and products.

But content marketers often lack the basic skill that all journalists are trained in: telling a story.  The narrative.  The progression from start to finish by someone we care about.  Most people need a narrative of some kind to make content come alive for them.

A tool I’ve found useful for turning dull content into engaging narrative is the Narrative Arc, which outlines the basic elements of a good story.

The Narrative Arc



Exposition: explains the landscape, gives context and background for the events about to happen

Complication/conflict: builds suspense with an issue or problem to be solved

Climax: describes the breakthrough – the ‘aha’ moment – when the path to a solution becomes clear

Resolution: the issue gets resolved

This simple formula provides the bare bones of most good stories – human interest news stories, movies, TV episodes, books, advertising, and yes, even good content marketing.  With marketing, there’s less time to spell out a full plot, so the narrative may need to be inferred.  Good advertising does this well.

Some good examples

The ad:    Apple’s iconic 1984 Super Bowl ad
The aha:  You don’t need to be a corporate lemming. You can express yourself creatively – with a Mac

The ad:    Google's ad for search: We’re All Storytellers
The aha:  Whatever my passion, I can learn all that I need – from Google search

The ad:    Guinness friendship advertisement
The aha:  True friendship is a warm feeling that comes from loyalty – and drinking beer together

You probably recognize the typical marketing narrative:  Customer, the main character, faces a problem because something is missing from his or her life.  Product provides the solution and thus solves the problem.  But where is the climax?  Where is the exciting breakthrough that makes a reader see the light?  That ‘aha’ moment is where the audience moves from identifying to empathizing with the main character.  It’s where the emotional connection happens.  And that’s what gets an audience hooked.

In tech marketing, it can be especially challenging to provide that climax.  After all, technology is so amazing, it provides its own exciting breakthrough, right?  Or, it takes such effort just to describe what the solution does and how it solves the customer’s problem, there’s no room left to create a climax. 

Here’s what I’ve seen many times in tech marketing:

No climax = No ""aha""



Or worse, no story



No wonder it falls flat on audience ears.  There’s no room for the audience to empathize with the challenge, to experience the climax, to internalize the impact of the breakthrough.  A product, no matter how amazing, won’t do that.  Neither will a listing of the product’s features and benefits.

Here are some examples of tech companies that tell an interesting story in their content marketing:

GE’s Ecomagination campaign:  through advertising, a website, and a magazine with an experienced managing editor, GE communicates the ‘aha’ that it is bringing innovative ideas to improve the health of our planet.  No product mentions needed.

Google’s Zero Moment of Truth campaign: Google has leveraged its research about how people buy online, at the ‘zero moment of truth’, by launching a widespread content marketing campaign that tells the story of today’s buyers and what that means for today’s marketers.  Demonstrated research value.

"Vertical Sales Initiative","vertical-sales-initiative","August 27, 2014","Bridge Partners helped a leading IT architecture solution provider build the sales and marketing plan they needed to win in a new vertical market.","","The Challenge

Rallying a sales team and giving it the right tools to go after a new market is no small task. When our client, an IT architecture solution provider, decided to formalize a go-to-market framework for the healthcare industry, the company needed more than campaign consulting. Our client needed a partner who could get its team smart and do it fast.

The Relationship

With early wins in the healthcare marketplace and customizable solutions for this dynamic and growing industry, our client was poised for success. But to expand its reach, the global IT leader needed a repeatable sales and marketing framework that would help its sales team speak consistently and effectively to this vertical.

Bridge Partners sales and marketing experts were the right team to tackle the problem. We brought our deep software sales and healthcare experience, along with highly collaborative and skilled marketing strategists who knew their way around an integrated go-to-market campaign.

After defining goals and success metrics, Bridge Partners applied a blend of discipline expertise, industry experience, and program management agility to drive the initiative forward. The result was a fully integrated healthcare sales and marketing plan with ready-to-launch collateral. The new messaging matched our client’s solutions with the most pressing business and IT concerns of healthcare customers to drive sales.

The Results

Our client is now armed with the knowledge it needs to position specific, relevant, and compelling solutions to the healthcare industry. Just as importantly, they now own a replicable vertical marketing framework that can be applied to any industry it chooses to tackle in the future.","

"Healthcare Change Management","healthcare-change-management","August 27, 2014","Bridge Partners helped a leading hospital system find a healthier approach to caregiver training and electronic health records.","","The Challenge

More than expensive IT investments were on the line when the nation’s fourth-largest healthcare system came to Bridge Partners. With dozens of hospitals and hundreds of clinics in a five-state region, the company strives to offer better quality of care by optimizing and enhancing the use of technology in the clinical environment. Our client had a critical need to train the staff of one of its hospitals on a new electronic health record (EHR) system without disrupting patient care.

 

The Relationship

After an intensive 18-month development process, the hospital’s transition from paper-based records to EHR was only weeks away from its go-live date. But with all of provider’s resources dedicated to completing the system build, shifting the team’s focus to the staff training would have been a major disruption. In addition, nurses and medical staff would have to participate in the training while continuing their daily caregiving and administrative duties.

Educating more than 1,000 students in less than six weeks meant that Bridge Partners needed to be agile, organizationally adept, and laser-focused on results. Bringing the right mix of technological savvy and experience in instructional design and training, Bridge Partners designed a change management plan and developed a full training syllabus. Live classroom training delivered by Bridge Partners instructors helped streamline the transition.

 

The Results

Bridge Partners used industry insight and EHR expertise to understand precisely how the system would function as part of the hospital’s everyday work environment. We created and delivered a relevant, concise curriculum to over 1,000 students in record time. Bridge Partners minimized training impact and focused on critical elements, making the best possible use of every training minute. The hospital’s staff quickly and effectively embraced the new software without having to sacrifice time for patient care.

The clinical results speak for themselves. As one nurse said, “This is the smoothest transition to a new technology that I’ve ever experienced. I knew what was coming and was able to make the change with minimum impact to my patients and my work.”","
